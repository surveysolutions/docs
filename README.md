# Survey Solutions documentation website

This repository contains articles (and binary files) from [https://docs.musyrvey.solutions](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions)

We use HUGO - static site generator framework to build this site. You can read more about Hugo
[here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).

## Contributing content

If you found a mistake in any article, cannot find describtion of a feature, or have any other suggestion to improve this documentation, you can simply create an issue.  
We would be absolutely delighted if you'd like to help by writing a new article. Feel free to create an issue, or a new topic on the [forum](https://forum.mysurvey.solutions) to discuss the changes with the team.

Once the content is agreed, following steps describe the process to add the new article:


- fork the repository and then clone it locally.

- download Hugo from [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) for your operating system - this is a single binary without *any* dependencies.

- create a new article by simply adding new file (with .md extension) to the appropriate section

- run hugo in the root folder (add hugo.exe to the path or call with the full path, i.e. c:\hugo\hugo.exe) to build the site and see whether there are any syntax errors.

- run hugo server to see how page/site looks like in the browser

- commit your changes and push to the remote repository
