Web-assignments – the assignments are extended to hold the respondent’s email and access password; Survey Solutions will interact with one of the several bulk email service providers to send invitations via email directly to the respondents; A system of reminders will notify the respondents that they haven’t started or haven’t finished their web interviews. Access to the web interviews is now password protected (optionally) providing additional confidentiality protection to the respondent’s answers. The Survey Setup page indicates which surveys are currently accepting web responses. As before a survey may accept responses from the internet (CAWI) and from the tablets (CAPI) with aggregation into a single export data file. As before you can create a landing page where all respondents will start interviews and interviews may be finished in several sessions. Multiselect combobox. Multiselect combobox is new compact representation of the multiselect question. It is most useful when the items are numerous (max 200) and lengthy and inconvenient to navigate. For example, the list of political parties, agricultural crops, or other similar items."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_us"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="release-notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2019-04-04T09:09:09+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2019-04-04T09:09:09+00:00"><meta property="og:image" content="https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/img/logo.png"><link rel=icon href=/img/favicon/favicon-support-1.png type=image/png sizes=16x16><link rel=icon href=/img/favicon/favicon-support-1-48-win-ico.png type=image/png sizes=48x48><link rel=icon href=/img/favicon/favicon-support-1-158-General-use-iOS-Android.png type=image/png sizes=152x152><link rel=icon href=/img/favicon/favicon-support-1-196-Chrome-for-Android.png type=image/png sizes=196x196><link rel=icon href=/img/favicon/favicon-support-1-558-win10-tile.png type=image/png sizes=558x558><title>Version 19.04</title><link rel=stylesheet href=https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css integrity=sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T crossorigin=anonymous><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700,900&amp;subset=cyrillic,cyrillic-ext,greek,greek-ext,latin-ext,vietnamese" rel=stylesheet><link href=/css/all.css rel=stylesheet><link href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ekko-lightbox/5.3.0/ekko-lightbox.css rel=stylesheet></head><body><header class="px-md-3 pt-3"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="mb-3 col-lg-6 col-md-12"><a class="navbar-brand text-white pr-0 mr-0 float-left" href=https://mysurvey.solutions/ target=_blank><img src=/img/logo.png alt="Survey Solutions" class=float-left>

The interviewer first
searches for a category, then posts it to the multiselect question. Each category
may be added only once to the selection and will not appear in the search results
if it is already posted as a selection. The syntax of expressions and export format
is exactly the same as for a regular multiselect question (with checkboxes).</p><a href=images/multiselect-combobox-design.png data-toggle=lightbox data-max-width=2400 class="d-block text-center"><img src=images/multiselect-combobox-design.png class='md-img mx-auto' alt></a><h2 id=cascading-with-list-of-categories>Cascading with list of categories.</h2><p>Cascading selection is a useful questionnaire element, which allows selecting an
answer category from a large number of choices in a sequence of refinements,
selecting from a smaller number of alternatives. It is typically used for selection
of an occupation, industry, or another similar selection.</p><p>Prior to this release, elements of cascading selection were presented as combobox
questions, which required the interviewer to start typing the selection before being
able to pick it from the list. Now the selection can be made directly from the list,
provided that the list of categories is no more than specified by the designer of the
questionnaire (max 50). If the number of choices happens to be more than the
specified threshold, the control automatically falls back to the old behavior and is
presented as a combobox.</p><p>In other words, the new representation of the cascading question shows lists of items
at each level of cascading as a series of single choice questions.</p><p>New behavior allows more streamlined and intuitive input, especially for the cases
where the choices at every step are few, such as moving from 1-digit to 2-digit to
3-digit to 4-digit industry classifications, with a choice from no more than 10
alternatives at every step of the cascade.</p><h2 id=other-notable-changes>Other notable changes</h2><ul><li><p>In exported data files the date and time will be written exactly as the interviewer
has seen it when the timestamp question was answered. This has been frequently
requested as more intuitive format, rather than the earlier export with adjustment
into a single time zone.</p></li><li><p>In exported data files the numbering of items in rosters triggered by numeric
questions is starting from zero. For example, if you have a roster <i>employees</i>
triggered by a numeric question <i>NumEmployees</i>, it will contain a numeric
<i>employees__id</i> variable with the values 0,1,2,&mldr; This is consistent with how
Survey Solutions was recording this information for a long time, though recent
versions started numbering with 1 for such cases. We have restored the original
behavior. The linked questions will contain exactly the ID value of the selected
item, regardless what the base for numbering is.</p></li><li><p>The status duration report is now available to the supervisors, not just the
HQ users.</p></li><li><p>Some of the Designer compilation error messages are now more verbose about the
exact limit and the current value, for example the estimation of total number of
roster items in the questionnaire.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to our Uruguayan user <i>Ms. Alicia Ortiz Perez</i> we&rsquo;ve managed to improve the
reliability of the data export procedures in cases of local server installations
with certain regional settings. Thank you for providing the helpful inputs into
this investigation!</p></li></ul><p><font color=maroon><b></p><p>(!) Version 19.04 is the <u>last</u> version of Survey Solutions that will be
