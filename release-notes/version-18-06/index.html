notification for self-hosted users:</span> the changes in the Designer
are compatibility-breaking so all users of Survey Solutions on the local
servers MUST upgrade to the latest version of the Survey Solutions
Headquarters application in order to import new questionnaires. For the
users of the Survey Solutions servers hosted in the World Bank Cloud the
update will be performed by our support staff.</span></p><h2 id=offline-gis-functionality-expansion>Offline GIS Functionality Expansion</h2><ol><li>Question type earlier called area is now renamed to geography and
supports capture of various geographic information:</li></ol><ul><li>area (polygons),</li><li>paths (polylines),</li><li>single (point) and</li><li>multiple (multipoint)</li></ul><p>on offline maps. Each selection is exported as vectors of points. This
question type is now accessible from the syntax to be used in
conditional and validation expressions. The following properties can be
used in the syntax:</p><ul><li><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace">double
geography.Area</span></li><li><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace">double
geography.Length</span></li><li><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace">int
geography.PointsCount</span></li></ul><p>In addition, the IsAnswered() function also supports this question type
now. For example, we can ask to show the secondary parcel if the primary
parcel has been already indicated:</p><pre><code>IsAnswered(primaryParcel)
</code></pre><p>Or we can indicate an error if the area of the parcel is too small to be
a parcel with a dwelling situated on it:</p><pre><code>self.Area&gt;=30
</code></pre><p>Or for large parcels we could ask if they are also being used for
agricultural purposes:</p><pre><code>primaryParcel.Area&gt;600
</code></pre><p>Similarly for the paths we can measure the length and show warnings, for
example, when they are unexpectedly large:</p><pre><code>self.Length&lt;=6000
</code></pre><ol><li>Offline maps formats have been extended with the raster files,
specifically <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF>GeoTIFF</a> files
that can be produced with a wide range of commercially available and
free to use tools.</li><li>BETA: A single <a href=/interviewer/shape-file-overlay>shapefile map can be added</a>
to the maps storage on the tablet, and if added in this way will be
automatically overlayed on top of the baseline map in offline map.</li></ol><h2 id=new-headquarters-features>New Headquarters Features</h2><ol><li>Online tabulation report based on the survey data allows creation of
tabulation reports (frequency tabulation of categorical variables)
with conditioning on values of other variables. For example, one can
now tabulate the interview result code by team members to check
whether a particular interviewer has abnormally large number of
households not found.</li></ol><a href=images/881381.png data-toggle=lightbox data-max-width=2400 class="d-block text-center"><img src=images/881381.png class='lg-img mx-auto' alt></a><ol><li>Upgrade of assignments: Survey Solutions will now assist the
Headquarters users in migrating assignments in case of a
questionnaire update. When a new version of an existing
questionnaire is imported to the server, any unfulfilled assignments
in the old version may be migrated to the new version. If the HQ
user decides to migrate the assignments, the system will examine
them one by one and decide whether the migration is possible and if
so, archive the original assignment and recreate a new assignment in
the new version of the questionnaire (for the remaining number of
interviews still not delivered). We recommend testing the
questionnaires extensively to minimize any revisions to the
questionnaires during fieldwork.</li><li>We have simplified the process of preloading to reduce the need for
data processing. Specifically,</li></ol><ul><li>for rosters triggered by text lists, the roster file may include
items with any codes (not necessarily in continuous or incremental
sequence);</li><li>for numeric rosters, the numeration of subordinate items in rosters
should start with 1 and proceed sequentially until N, N will be
saved into the value of the trigger question;</li></ul><p>In both cases the items will appear in rosters in the order of
increasing IDs specified in preloading. These changes help Survey
Solutions preload the very same files that it exports and reduces the
burden of preparation of data for preloading in panel surveys.</p><ol><li><a href=/headquarters/preloading/protecting-pre-loaded-answers/>Protection of answers to preloaded
questions</a>
is available in advanced preloading only for questions of type
multi-select, numeric and text list. This feature may be most useful
for panel surveys where data obtained in the initial visit must be
protected, while at the same time it must be extended by new values.
A typical scenario is that the list of household members may need to
be extended with new household members, while original household
members need to be protected from deletion from the list.</li><li>The Interview report in Headquarters/Supervisor is now more specific
about errors in the questionnaire. Previously a flag was raised if
the questionnaire contained any errors. This has been indicated to
the supervisors in the list of interviews. Now this column reflects
the number of questions with errors (n.b. this may be different from
the total number of errors) (as per request of Lena Nguyen, World
Bank).</li><li>New API request can be sent to the Survey Solutions data server that
returns the interview data for a particular interview in JSON
format. Images and other binary resources and comments are not
included in this response.</li><li><a href=/headquarters/detailed-action-log>Log of actions undertaken on the
tablet</a> accessible from the
Headquarters. In it the headquarters users can monitor all the
actions by the interviewer on a tablet, including actions on
interviews that are still not completed. For example:</li></ol><p><a href=images/881382.png data-toggle=lightbox data-max-width=2400 class="d-block text-center"><img src=images/881382.png class='md-img mx-auto' alt>
</a>This log is useful in resolving the debates where the interviewer claims
that the data was collected, but subsequently &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo;.</p><ol><li>New online map report for interviewer movement shows historical
positions (trajectory) of the interviewer on the map. This report is
interviewer-specific and is available on the interviewer profile
page. It shows the location of all of the interviewer&rsquo;s interviews
in chronological order, along with colors highlighting the current
status of each interview: started (blue), completed (green) or
rejected (red).</li></ol><a href=images/881380.png data-toggle=lightbox data-max-width=2400 class="d-block text-center"><img src=images/881380.png class='lg-img mx-auto' alt></a><ol start=2><li>Interviewer profile also contains a new warning (red message:
“Relinked”) if the interviewer has relinked his/her device.</li></ol><h2 id=new-interviewer-features>New Interviewer Features</h2><ol><li>Multiple selection questions will disable remaining choices when the
maximum number of choices has been selected to indicate to
interviewers that no more selections can be made in this question
(as requested by Sergiy Radyakin, World Bank).</li><li>Behavior of the linked question has changed. Earlier, any changes to
the source question caused all dependent linked questions throughout
the questionnaire to be &ldquo;unanswered&rdquo;. Now, only those items removed
from the source are removed from the linked questions, with other
items selection not affected. For example, if Peter was the only
household member, and selected as the household head in a linked
question, then adding Mary to the list of the household members does
not change the indicated status ‘head of the household’ for Peter,
even though Mary will be available for selection there.</li><li>On the tablet the interviewers can now replay the recording of the
audio question by pressing the play button and can zoom to see the
photo taken in the image question. Both allow to perform quality
control immediately on the tablet and decide whether the audio
recordings (photos) are of suitable quality or need to be taken
again (requested by Eugene Ehlers, AHRI; Phil Bright, SPC).</li><li>We have added several new functions to extend our syntax and
expanded existing to support more types of data where earlier
typecasts were required.</li><li>We have extended the translations in Chinese and Arabic, and added
Romanian language interface for the Interviewer App.</li></ol></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer pt-3 pb-1 px-sm-3 px-lg-0"><div class="container copyright"><div class=float-left>&#169; 2016-2025 The World Bank Group.<br>All rights Reserved. <a href=https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/legal _target=blank>Legal</a><br><a class=text-primary href=/about/ _target=blank><b class=text-primary>About the team</b></a>
