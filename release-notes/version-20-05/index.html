interviews from the tablet to the server. A number of our users
have described partial synchronization of the interviews as
extremely important for their surveys. Partial synchronization
allows sending the information from the tablet to the server,
while keeping the interview data on the tablet. This has numerous
advantages, among which:</p><ul><li><em>Increased reliability</em>: if the tablet is lost or damaged, the
server will contain the last state of the interview when it was
synchronized, and the interviewer will be able to resume from that
state on a different device;</li><li><em>Better interaction with the supervisor</em>, who can now start
reviewing (and commenting) the beginning of the interview even
before it is fully realized.</li></ul><p>But partial synchronization comes at a cost of higher traffic,
which may or may not be desirable. Hence the partial synchronization
is an opt-in. Whether to enable partial synchronization is up to
the administrator of the server, who can enable it in the server&rsquo;s
settings.</p><h3 id=two-factor-authentication-2fa>Two-factor authentication (2FA)</h3><p>Two-factor authentication enhances security of the system by
requiring an additional method of confirming the identity of
the user. Compared to simple password-based systems, this
method relies on confirmation on two channels:</p><ol><li>Something the user knows (password);</li><li>Something the user has (security token).</li></ol><p>The security token is typically implemented as a software
running on the user’s phone with a wide range of
implementations for various platforms (Android, iOS, Windows,
Windows Mobile, etc).</p><p>Any user of Survey Solutions server can now enable the
two-factor authentication for his (her) account in the account
profile.</p><p>Read more about how to set up and use the two factor
authentication in
<a href=/headquarters/accounts/two-factor-authentication/>this article</a>.</p><h3 id=filtering-interviews-by-identifying-questions>Filtering interviews by identifying questions</h3><p>The list of interviews can contain many thousands of interviews
in the large surveys. Locating specific interviews may be
overwhelming. That’s why we have introduced the filter for
interviews based on the identifying questions (defined by the
Designer).</p><p>To use the filters, first select the questionnaire and version
(since the questions may differ in different questionnaires),
then click <strong>Questions selector</strong> button and select the questions
you want to be part of the filter and confirm your selection
with <strong>OK</strong> button. Then specify the values you want to be used
to filter the interviews, for example, only interviews from a
particular enumeration area, state, or phone number.</p><h3 id=split-of-the-hq-list-of-interviews-into-processed-and-in-progress>Split of the HQ list of interviews into processed and in-progress</h3><p>Large surveys may run for years and involve conducting millions
of interviews. Usually, once they are approved by the Headquarters
users, that’s the terminal state and no further actions are needed.
The new feature allows to de-clutter the HQ-users&rsquo; workspace. By
default now the HQ-user sees the list of the interviews that are
not approved by the HQ yet (in all other statuses). This will
allow them to focus on the tasks that are still in the progress.
If necessary, all interviews may be seen at the same time by
switching the corresponding filter setting.</p><h3 id=other-changes>Other changes:</h3><ul><li><p>The list of the interviews is now reformatted to use the space
within the columns more efficiently, variable labels of identifying
questions are used instead of question texts where provided, and
the column width is automatically adjusted to accommodate more
content when multiple identifying questions are defined in the
questionnaire.</p></li><li><p>Interviews that are approved by the Headquarters users are no
longer displayed in the list of the interviews with default
settings as they need no further processing.</p></li><li><p>Tablets running earlier versions of the interviewer app may send
an interview to the updated server (to 20.5) without an update, but
will require an update when receiving rejected interviews. This is
normal.</p></li><li><p>Sections in disabled state were previously always hidden. Now
they will obey their individual <strong>hide-if-disabled</strong> flag. Check
your earlier designed questionnaires to verify their behavior.</p></li><li><p>Assignments are sorted on the tablets in the natural order of
their identifying fields: first by the first identifying fields,
then (if there are ties) by the second identifying field, and so on.
This should simplify locating assignments in the dashboard that are
targeting respondents in the same or near-by areas.</p></li><li><p>When assignments being preloaded contain a GPS question that has
values for latitude and longitude specified will also preload the
GPS acquisition date with a default value.</p></li><li><p>Rejection notifications to the respondents were previously not
delivered through the mass mail service for web interviews as was
reported in the <a href=https://forum.mysurvey.solutions/t/download-web-link/2399>users&rsquo; forum</a>.</p></li></ul></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer pt-3 pb-1 px-sm-3 px-lg-0"><div class="container copyright"><div class=float-left>&#169; 2016-2025 The World Bank Group.<br>All rights Reserved. <a href=https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/legal _target=blank>Legal</a><br><a class=text-primary href=/about/ _target=blank><b class=text-primary>About the team</b></a>
