Why update
----------

There are several reasons why:

-   **New features.** With most releases of Survey Solutions, new
    features are introduced--new question types, new user interface, new
    actions, etc. To take advantage of new features, the Interviewer
    application must be updated.
-   **Bug fixes and performance improvements.** Each releases of Survey
    Solutions contains numerous bugs and performance improvements. To
    avoid bugs and ensure the best performance, the Interviewer
    application should be updated regularly.
-   **Break with backwards compatibility.** In general, older versions
    of the Interviewer application will continue to work with an updated
    Headquarters server. In some cases relatively rare cases, however,
    new features break this backwards compatibility. When this happens,
    the Interviewer application needs to be updated so that the tablet
    can continue communicating with the server.

When to update
--------------

At a minimum, the Interviewer application should be updated every month.
Every two months, typically a new version of Survey Solutions is
released. In the intervening time, smaller updates and bug fixes are
released.

How to know when update are available
-------------------------------------

For Headquarters and Supervisor users, the Teams and Roles &gt;
Interviewers tab provides a report of which version of Interviewer each
interviewer is using. If application used is old, the cell in the APP
VERSION column will appear in red.  
  
{{< imgproc "images/858257.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
To navigate there, follow these steps. For Headquarters, click on Teams
and Roles, and then select Interviewers. For Supervisor, simply click on
Teams and Roles.  
  
For Interviewers, the <A href="/interviewer/troubleshooting/interviewer-app-diagnostics/">Diagnostics dialog of the Interviewer App</A>
provides an easy tool for checking whether a new version of Interviewer
is available. The steps for doing so are discussed immediately below.

How to update
-------------

First, select Diagnostics from the Interview application's overflow
menu  
  
{{< imgproc "images/858259.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
Then, tap on Check for a new version to check whether a newer version of
Interviewer exists than the one currently installed on the tablet.  
  
{{< imgproc "images/858258.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
If the Interviewer application is up to date, the Check for new version
prompt will say so.  
{{< imgproc "images/858260.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
If a newer version of the Interviewer application is available, tap on
the UPDATE button to download and install it.  
{{< imgproc "images/858262.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
Note: to minimize the amount of data used for this operation, the
Interviewer application will fetch the updates only, not the large file
that is used for a fresh download of Interviewers.  
  
If the process outlined above does not work, or if users need a
different mechanism, the Interviewer application can always be
downloaded from the Headquarters website and installed. To learn how,
refer to [this article](/getting-started/download-and-install-the-interviewer-application).
