Setting up the Interviewer App just got much easier. 

Previously, set-up required manually inputting three parameters: 

*   URL of the server, 
*   login of the interviewer, 
*   and the password of the interviewer.

The first two of which are stored immutably after being entered. Now, Survey Solutions HQ displays a QR-code in the interviewer’s profile that can be scanned by the tablet to automate set-up. To do this, press the QR-code button during the initialization phase, and point the tablet camera at the screen displaying the QR-code or a print out of the QR-code. Server URL/IP and user login name will be prefilled. The password is never read or shown as a QR-code and still must be entered manually. This simplifies the entry of the configuration information, especially when it is an IP address and not a server name.
