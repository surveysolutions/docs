Overview of the Interviewer Dashboard
-------------------------------------

  
The Interviewer dashboard offers an overview of the interviewer’s
assignments and the state of completion they are in. The tabs displayed
at the top of the dashboard sorts interviews by their status.

### Navigation between tabs

To navigate between the different tabs, the interviewer can either tap
on the tab at the top bar or swipe left or right. To help interviewers
differentiate between the different tabs, the color of the dashboard
will change based on which tab the interviewer is currently in. The
interface will be grey for the **Create New** tab, blue for
the **Started **tab, green for the **Completed** tab, and red for
the **Rejected** tab.

### Information for Assignments

The card for each assignment will have a number at the top. This number
will correspond to the assignment number that Headquarters and
Supervisors user will also use to identify the assignment. Next to the
assignment number will be the number of interviews that remains to be
completed by the interviewer. This number will decrease as the
interviewer completes more interviews.  
  
Additionally, each card will be have the identifying information for
each assignment or interview. The first three identifying variables will
be shown on the card for each assignment or interview. If there are more
than three identifying variables for the assignment, the rest will be
hidden. To reveal the other identifying information, tap once on the
assignment's card.

Interview statuses

There are four possible statuses on the Dashboard:

    interviewer has. Interviewers can create new interviews for their
    assignments. To start a new interview, interviewers will tap on the
    blue ***Start*** button on the assignment. If all the required
    interviews for an assignment have already been created, then the
    ***Start*** will be grayed out. The dashboard will be grey while in
    this tab.  
    {{< imgproc "images/829847.png" Fit "800x600" />}}

    but not yet completed. To open an incomplete interview, simply tap
