The Interviewer application responds to the device language setting of
tablets. Localization affects the interface of the application, such as
menus, dialogs and application error messages. The languages currently
supported are:

-   English
-   French
-   Spanish
-   Portuguese
-   Russian
-   Thai
-   Indonesian
-   Khmer
-   Chinese
-   Arabic
-   Romanian

Note that you can still design the questionnaire itself in any language,
including the texts of the questions, their options, instructions, and
validation messages.Â
