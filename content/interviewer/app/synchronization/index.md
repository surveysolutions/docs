Sending completed interviews and receiving new ones
---------------------------------------------------

  
The synchronization button is how the interviewer initiates an
information exchange between their tablet and their supervisor’s laptop.
Synchronization performs two tasks. First, it automatically pushes any
completed assignment to the supervisor for review. Second, it
automatically pulls all new assignments and data collection instruments
onto the interviewer’s tablet. After synchronization is complete, the
number of new assignments received, number of completed interviews sent,
and so on are clearly displayed.
