Overview of the dashboard interface
-----------------------------------

 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="/images/658209.png" /></td>
<td><img src="/images/658208.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
  
The dashboard offers a functional overview of the interviewer’s
assignments and the state they are in. The links displayed at the top of
the dashboard sorts survey cases by their status. New, which means the
assignment is not complete; Completed, which means the assignment has
been marked by the interviewer as complete; or Rejected, which means the
supervisor has reviewed the assignment, found problems, and returned it
to the interviewer for correction. Under each link (status) individual
assignments are displayed as rows . Each row contains the set of
information that the interviewer should use to identify the interview
assignment. For example, this may be the name of the household and their
location information.  
  
The dashboard differs slightly in appearance between sample survey mode,
the image above to the left, and census mode, the image above to the
right. In survey sample mode, where assignments are sent from the
supervisor’s computer to interviewers’ tablet, the dashboard lists the
assignments for each instrument. In census mode, where assignments are
created by interviewers on their tablets, the dashboard lists
instruments that can be used by the interviewer to create new
assignments by clicking on the *Create Interview* button associated with
the instrument of interest.

You will be directed back to the dashboard. The previously opened

any other assignment.  
  
 

How to resume an assignment
---------------------------

  
Navigate to the Dashboard. Then, find the assignment that you would like
to resume and tap it. Doing so will reopen the assignment. All your
previous work will be present. However, the Interviewer application will
open to the first section in the questionnaire.
