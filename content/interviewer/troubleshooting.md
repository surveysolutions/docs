-   Manually back up the data collected to Headquarters
-   Create a backup of data collected on the tablet device
-   Share device specifications and information

These actions are not typically taken by the interviewer, but rather by
the supervisor or the surveys technical support in the case of
troubleshooting problems on a particular tablet.  
  
  
 

Settings
--------

  
The interviewer should never navigate to the *settings* screen. **Only

contents of this screen.**
