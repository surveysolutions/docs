Next, use filters to find the cases to be assigned. Consider the
following common scenarios.

  Case not yet assigned to an interviewer
----------------------------------------

 

Select the name of the survey from the *Templates* menu. Then,
select *SupervisorAssigned* from the status menu.  
  
This will display all of the survey cases that have not yet been
assigned to an interviewer for a particular survey or version of a
survey (as displayed below).  
  
{{< imgproc "images/772987.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
  
Next, select the check box to the left of the survey case(s) to be
assigned to an interviewer. Then, click on *Assign* and select an
interviewer from the pop-up menu. This will assign the selected survey
case(s) to the selected interviewer. The interviewer will see these new
assignments on the dashboard of their tablet upon the next
synchronization.   
  
 

Case to be reassigned to another interviewer
--------------------------------------------

  
You may need to change survey case assignments because of interviewer
job performance issues, illness, and management of the team’s workload.
For example, reassigning a survey case from an overloaded interviewer to
an interviewer that has time.  
  
   
{{< imgproc "images/772988.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
  
The protocol for changing assignments vary depending on the interview
status.  There are three possible scenarios:  
 

1.  To change assignments of interviews that have not yet been
    synchronized with interviewer’s tablets, select the interview cases
    that need to be reassigned. Then, type the username for the
    interviewer who should now be responsible for the cases in the
    *Interview name* text box.
2.  To change assignments of interviews that have been synchronized with
    interviewer’s tablets, first select the interview cases that need to
    be reassigned. Then, type the username for the interviewer who
    should now be responsible for these cases in the *Interview
    name* text box. You will then be prompted to confirm the change in
    assignments. Note that any data collected for these cases by the
    former interviewer will be lost. 
3.  To change assignments of completed interviews, select the interviews
    you want to reassign by clicking the checkbox. Reject these
    interviews by pressing *Reject* button on the toolbar, then reassign
    the interviews to another interviewer. In this case, all collected
    information will be saved.  
      
    Another similar scenario where this protocol can be applied is
    when the first interviewer has opened a number of assignments and
    needs the second interviewer to finish them, he/she should mark them
    as completed (even they are only partially filled out) and let the
    supervisor know to reject them to the second interviewer. In that
    case the data already collected to date will flow over to the second
    interviewer.
