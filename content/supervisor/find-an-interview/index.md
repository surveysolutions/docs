<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Use filters to
narrow down your search—by **questionnaire**, by **team member**, and by
**survey status**.</span>  
  
Keep in mind that after an interview has been approved by a supervisor
and is sent to the headquarters users, the supervisor no longer sees the
interview on the dashboard. <span
style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">   
  
Click on the ***Interviews tab*** at the top of the screen:  
 </span>

<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">By questionnaire      </span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To filter by
questionnaire, move your cursor to the <span class="underline">Filter
panel at the left of the screen</span>. Then, click on the drop-down
menu below ***Templates***. Select the *questionnaire* whose survey
assignments you want to see.  
   
  
  
{{< imgproc "images/772992.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
  
The results will be a list of only those assignments for that particular
*questionnaire*, regardless of who is responsible for them or what their
status is.  
  
  
{{< imgproc "images/772993.png" Fit "800x600" />}}</span>

 <span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">By assigned team member</span>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To filter by the
team member responsible, click on the drop-down menu below
***Responsible*** and select the team member whose assignments you want
to see.  
   
  
{{< imgproc "images/772994.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
  
This will yield a list of all the assignments *for that team member*.
The supervisor is also one team member that can be selected. Selecting
the supervisor’s questions so will provide a list of all those
assignments that have been sent to the supervisor by headquarters but
not allocated to any other team members. </span>  
  
  
 

<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">By status</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  
<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To filter by
status, click on the drop-down menu below <span
class="underline">Status</span> and select the status of interest.  
   
  
{{< imgproc "images/772995.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
This will return the survey assignments that are in a given status. Of
particular interest may be assignments whose status is <span
class="underline">Completed</span>. The <span
class="underline">Completed</span> cases need to be *reviewed* and
*approved* or *rejected* by the supervisor.  
  
{{< imgproc "images/772998.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
 <span style="line-height: 1.2;">An explanation of each survey status
can be found in this
