The supervisor software is a suite of connected tools for the
supervisor:

-   to track the progress of their team (**Reports**)
-   manage the quality of their work (**Interviews**)
-   manage their members of the team (**Teams and Roles**)
-   and monitor and manage assignments (**Assignments**)

  
The following section will provide an overview of each
tool—[Reports](#Reports), [Interviews,](#Interviews) [Teams and
Roles](#Teams), [Assignments](#Assignments).  
  
 

<span id="Reports"></span>Reports
---------------------------------

  
**Reports **tab provides four different types of reports: *Survey and
Statuses*, *Team members and Statuses*, *Quantity* and *Speed*.  For
example, the *Surveys and Statuses* report (shown below), presents a
summary of assignments by questionnaire. Details on each report type and
ways to tailor each report are explained in the see the [reports
article](/supervisor/see-the-overall-progress-of-data-collection).  
  
 

<span id="Interviews"></span>Interviews
---------------------------------------

  
The Interview panel constitutes the core of where supervisor does their
work. It is a detailed list of survey assignments. To find this list,
click on the **Interviews** tab at the top of the screen.  
The Interview interface consists of several pieces:  
 

1.  The list of interview cases (marked 1 in the image below), which
    captures location information (*Identifying questions*), which
    member is responsible (*Responsible*), when the assignment was last
    updated <span class="underline">(</span>*Last Updated*), whether it
    contains errors (*Has Errors*), and what status it has (*Status*).
2.  Set of filters (marked 2) for narrowing the list down to the
    questionnaire (*Template*), team member responsible (*Responsible*),
    and/or assignment status (*Status*).
3.  Tool that appears when one more check boxes associated with cases
    are selected (marked 3). This can be used for approving or rejecting
    assignments. 
4.  Interview key, which is a system generated random number for each
    survey assignment (marked 4). Click on this number to open the
    survey case to review. 
5.  Search tool, which can be used to find survey cases through keywords
    (marked 5).

The Interview panel allows the supervisor to:

-   *Review* completed assignments, and reject or approve the
    assignments.

  
**For any completed assignment**, the supervisor clicks on
the *interview key* associated with that interview case (depicted as 4
in the figure above). The supervisor software then opens an interface
for reviewing, commenting, and approving or rejecting the case.  
  
The **Interview review panel **has several components (as displayed
below):  
  
![](/images/772958.png)  
 

1.  *Filters (marked 1 in the image above) *are on the left-hand of the
    screen. They allow the supervisor to navigate from one section of
    the questionnaire to another by clicking on a heading. Bolded
    headings represent sections. Indented headings represent groups of
    questions or rows of rosters.
2.  *Additional filters (2)* are on the top right-hand segment of the
    screen. They facilitate the display of questions that may be of
    interest to the supervisor.  The *All* filter presents all
    questions. The *commented* and *flag*** **filters display those
    questions with comments or flags, respectively.
    The *answered* questions, as the name suggests, are all those that
    have an answer. The *invalid* filter displays those questions that
    failed a validation check (e.g., range, consistency with other
    responses, etc.). The *supervisor’s* filter yields those special
    questions that only the supervisor sees and can answer.
    The *enabled* and* hidden* filter returns questions that are
    available to be answered based on the skip logic of the
    questionnaire and answers provided to key questions.
3.  *The center part of the screen (3)* lists the questions and the
    answers of the content being reviewed.
4.  *The last column to the right (4)* is where the supervisor reads
    comments from the interviewer and provides comments to the
    interviewer.
5.  The final components are the green approve button and red reject
    button (5). These important buttons determine whether the assignment
    is sent to headquarters for inclusion in the survey database
    (*Approve*) or returned to the interviewer for correction
    (*Reject*).

 

<span id="Teams"></span>Teams and Roles
---------------------------------------

  
Another component of the supervisor software is the *Interviewer
dashboard*, opened through clicking on the **Teams and Roles tab** at
the top of the screen.  
  
This component is responsible for the small parts of human resource
management that the supervisor handles. Headquarters determines which
human resources are in which team. Supervisor is relegated to the role
of managing the user accounts for their team. To do so, the supervisor
clicks on the team member's name.

<span id="Assignments"></span>Assignments
-----------------------------------------

The final major component of the supervisor software is the assignments
tab. This is where the supervisor can see the assignments allocated from
Headquarters and allocate the assignments to his/her team members. For
more detailed information, refer to the
[Assignments](/supervisor/distribute-an-assignment) article.
