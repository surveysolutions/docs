Binary data files, such as pictures and audio recordings are often large
and can be time-consuming to download. One can now opt for pushing the
data to own cloud storage, rather than downloading directly. The
following cloud storage repositories are supported:

-   DropBox;
-   Google Drive;
-   OneDrive.

The direct download of binary data in the form of a single large
zip-archive remains available. To push the data to the cloud storage,
select the corresponding option in the download dialog, then
authenticate yourself with the corresponding cloud storage provider:

<span class="underline">Note</span> that despite the cloud-to-cloud data
transfer is usually faster than direct download, it may still take
significant time to complete, especially for large surveys.
