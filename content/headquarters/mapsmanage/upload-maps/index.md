In Survey Solutions all maps are first uploaded to the server, then
distributed to the interviewers based on assignments of maps.

This functionality is accessible for the users in roles `headquarters` and
`administrator` only.

One or multiple maps in acceptable [map formats](/headquarters/svymanage/map-formats/) are uploaded in archived form (as a single *.zip archive)
using: `Survey Setup` --> `Maps` --> `Upload ZIP file`
