This page is available for Administrators, Headquarters users and
Supervisors. It is often the case that users have difficulty finding and
checking the status of certain cases that they are responsible for.

1.  [Search for a survey case that was conducted in Census mode by
    providing the the *questionnaire name*, the *interviewer*, and *date
    range* for which synchronization could have occurred](#census). 
2.  [Search for a survey case by its system generated *interview key*
    or* interview ID*. ](#key/id)
