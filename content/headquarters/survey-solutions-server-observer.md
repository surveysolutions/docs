Observer is an optional account, kind of an HQ user with a limited
functionality, to passively monitor a survey.Â Observer accesses
information through impersonation, looking through the eyes of a
different user.  
  
An observer **can do**:

-   Read individual interviews including any comments left;
-   See reports;
-   See lists of users and their profiles.

An observer **can not do**:

-   approve/reject interviews;
-   create/delete assignments.
-   any other change-state operations;
-   download data.

An observer account is created **for a server, not for a survey**! Hence
an observer user may monitor the activity in all surveys that are
running on the server.
