Reports provide headquarters with a summary of the status of
fieldwork—of progress [by questionnaire](#survey%20status), [by
team](#team%20and%20status), [by status duration](#duration), [by
devices/interviewers](#device/inter), [by geography](#map%20report), [by
quantity](#quantity), [by speed](#speed), or on detailed [survey
statistics](#stat).

<span id="survey status"></span>By questionnaire template
---------------------------------------------------------

  
The *Surveys and Statuses* report summarizes the progress of each survey
that headquarters is overseeing (i.e., data collection with a given
template). The anatomy of the report is as follows. The column labeled
“Survey Name” contains the name of each survey. The subsequent columns
correspond to each possible status of a survey case in the Survey
Solutions survey workflow. (For a detailed explanation of the workflow
and the statuses, see the [Survey
Workflow](/headquarters/survey-workflow) article.) Each cell in the
report captures the number of cases that are in a given state for a
given survey (e.g., number of “Complete” assignments for “Household
Roster”).  
  
![](/images/773982.png)  
  
By default, this report summarizes the status of survey cases over all
supervisors—it reports the total sum of survey cases in each status,
summing over all supervisors. This report can be filtered to provide a
summary or focus on one supervisor at a time.  
  
To do this, click on the drop-down menu below *Supervisors* filter and
select a name.  
  
![](/images/773983.png)  
  
  
Doing so will yield a summary of progress for only the selected
supervisor. In other words, filtering allows headquarters to focus on
the progress of an individual supervisor.

<span id="team and status"></span>By team
-----------------------------------------

  
The *Team and Statuses* report provides a status report for each
supervisor. The first column of the report lists all supervisors under
headquarters’ supervision. The subsequent columns correspond to each
possible status of a survey case in the Survey Solutions workflow. Each
cell captures the number of cases in a particular status for a specific
supervisor.  
By default, the *Teams and Statuses* report provides a global summary of
progress at the supervisor level. Headquarters can filter the report in
order to obtain a more granular view of progress by questionnaire
template. To do this, click on the drop-down menu located below
*Questionnaire*. Then, select a particular questionnaire to see each
team’s progress for that questionnaire alone.  
  
![](/images/773987.png)  
  
Doing so will generate a summary of progress for the chosen template.  
  
![](/images/773988.png)

<span id="duration"></span>By status duration
---------------------------------------------

The Status Duration report carefully flags lack of progress. While other
reports count interview cases, this report includes both assignments and
interview cases. By seeing how many days interviews stay in the same
status, survey managers can see whether survey operations are moving
forward, and identify any bottlenecks (e.g., slow approval by
supervisors, slower reactions by HQ, etc.). By clicking on any cell in
the report, managers can drill down to the details of which
assignments/interviewers and/or field staff are behind interviews
stagnating in the same status.   
  
Headquarters can filter the report in order to obtain a more granular
view of progress by questionnaire. To do this, click on the drop-down
menu located below *Questionnaire*. Then, select a particular
questionnaire to see the report for that template alone.

<span id="device/inter"></span>By devices/interviewers
------------------------------------------------------

The Devices/Interviewers report compiles potential problems that can
occur during data collect, such as never been able to synchronize with
the server (*Never Connected),* using an old version of Interviewer
(*Old Version*)*,* etc.* *This information can make troubleshooting
easier for survey managers.   
  
By clicking on any cell in the report, Headquarters can find the
associated interviewer names/accounts. 

![](/images/818592.png) <span id="map report"></span>By geography
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  
The *Map Report* shows the geographic location of all completed
questionnaires on Google Maps.  
  
To use this report:

1.  Select *Maps Report* from the Reports menu. This will open the
    interface for creating this type of report
2.  Select the questionnaire you want to map from the Questionnaire
    drop-down menu.
3.  Select the geo-location variable from the questionnaire that you
    wish to plot on the map. This will plot completed questionnaires on
    a map, showing their geographical dispersion and providing some
    sense of where survey teams have and have not reached.

<span id="quantity"></span>By quantity
--------------------------------------

  
The *Quantity* report tab provides the following reports for each
questionnaire template:

-   **Number of completed interviews:** Provides the number of completed
    interviews for each data collection team. Interviews that have been
    rejected and then completed are counted as an additional completed
    interview.  
      
    ![](/images/773997.png)
-   **Number of interview transactions by HQ:** Provides the number of
    headquarters approvals and rejections for each data collection
    team.  
      
    ![](/images/773993.png)
-   **Number of interviews approved by HQ:** Provides the number of
    headquarters approved interviews for each data collection team.  
      
    ![](/images/773994.png)
-   **Number of interview transactions by supervisor:** Provides the
    number of supervisor approvals and rejections on interviews
    collected by each data collection team.  
      
    ![](/images/773995.png)  
     

 

### Creating a quantity report

![](/images/774000.png)To use these report, first select *Quantity* from
the Reports menu. Then, select the *Type* of report and the
questionnaire template.  
Select a start date for the report (*From*).  Next, define the time
interval-- day, week, or month (*Period*), and the number of time
intervals that you would like to display in the report (*Period count*).
The maximum period count that can be defined is 9.  
  
  
By default, the *Quantity* report delivers reports at the supervisor
level. However, you can obtain a more granular view across one data
collection team by selecting a supervisor from the *Team* column.

 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 

<span id="speed"></span>By speed
--------------------------------

  
The *Speed* report tab provides the following reports for each
questionnaire template:

-   **Average interview duration:** Provides the average time difference
    between the first recorded answer on a tablet and when the complete
    button is selected.  
    ![](/images/774006.png)  
     
-   **Average supervisor processing time**: Provides the average time
    difference between the moment the complete button is pressed and the
    supervisor’s approval or rejection of that questionnaire.  
      
    ![](/images/774007.png)
-   **Average HQ processing time:** Provides the average time difference
    between a supervisor approval of a questionnaire and a HQ approval
    or rejection of that questionnaire.  
      
    ![](/images/774008.png)
-   **Average case assignment duration:** Provides the average time
    difference between survey case assignment to an interviewer and the
    moment an interviewer sets the survey case as complete on a
    tablet.  
      
    ![](/images/774009.png)
-   **Average overall case processing time:** Provides the average time
    difference between survey case assignment and survey case approval
    by HQ.  
      
    ![](/images/774010.png)

 

### Creating a speed report

  
![](/images/774012.png)  
To use these reports, first select *Speed* from the Reports menu. Then,
select the *Type* of report and the questionnaire template. Select a
start date for the report (*From*). Next, define the time interval--
day, week, or month (*Period*), and the number of time intervals that
you would like to display in the report (*Period count*). The maximum
period count that can be defined is 9.  
  
Similar to the Quantity reports, Speed reports by default provide the
report at the supervisor level. However, you can obtain a more granular
view across one data collection team by selecting a supervisor from the
*Team* column.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 

<span id="stat"></span>Survey Statistics 
-----------------------------------------

The Survey Statistics report allows the creation of tabulation reports
(frequency tabulation of categorical variables) with conditioning on
values of other variables. Use the filters on the left-hand side to
define the questionnaire, question, view option (by team members or
team), and the condition question (if applicable).   
  
![](/images/886343.png)  
  
For example, you can tabulate the interview result code by team members
to check whether a particular interviewer has an abnormally large number
of households not found.
