supervisor in the system.

Repeat these steps for each of your supervisors.  
  
  
 

Step 3

**Create accounts for enumerators in each team**

of the headquarters dashboard. On the new screen, click *Create*.

{{< imgproc "images/744261.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
Then, complete the form displayed. Use the Supervisor drop down menu to
assign the interviewer to a supervisor.   
  
Lastly, click on *Create *to add the enumerator in the system.   
  
{{< imgproc "images/774057.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
Repeat this procedure for each enumerator.   
  
If you need to create a lot of user accounts for your survey,
Headquarters allows [batch creation of user
accounts](/customer/en/portal/articles/2483438-batch-user-upload)
