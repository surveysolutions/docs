Every Survey Solutions server has an administrator. This is the first user
account created after Survey Solutions is installed, typically by the same
person who performed the installation.

An administrator can do (almost) everything an HQ user can do plus some
exclusive actions:

-   [create HQ](/headquarters/teams-and-roles-tab-creating-user-accounts-#hqaccounts)
    user accounts,
    [observer](/headquarters/teams-and-roles-tab-creating-user-accounts-#observer)
    user accounts and
    [API](/headquarters/survey-solutions-api)
    user accounts (in addition to supervisors and interviewers as an HQ
    user can do), change passwords for these users;
-   [set up a logo for the server and the tablets](/headquarters/admin-settings);
-   [leave a message for all of the HQ users and supervisors](/headquarters/admin-settings);
-   [password-protect downloadable data](/headquarters/admin-settings);
-   [delete a survey](/faq/deleting-a-survey)
    (questionnaire and all data);
-   unarchive a user;
-   inspect the [server audit log](/headquarters/svymanage/audit-log/).

Note that a server administrator may not be designated responsible for
assignments, while a headquarters user may be.

<BR>
Administrator is a privileged account and can do important actions which
may result in damage to data. Assign a responsible and informed person
as an administrator! We recommend that the administrator has attended a comprehensive
Survey Solutions training.

Some obvious security recommendations:

-   do not share the administrator password;
-   do not forget the administrator password;
-   do not mention the administrator password in emails;
-   do not use administrator account for day-to-day HQ operations.

See more recommendations in the [Password Best Practices](/interviewer/app/password-best-practices/).
