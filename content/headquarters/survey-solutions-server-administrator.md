Every Survey Solutions server has an administrator:

-   **Local server** - the first user created after Survey Solutions is installed.
-   **Cloud server** - the credentials are sent to the client that
    [requested the server](/faq/cloud-server-request).

An administrator can do everything an HQ user can do plus some exclusive
actions:

-   [create HQ](/headquarters/teams-and-roles-tab-creating-user-accounts-#hqaccounts)
    user accounts,
    [observer](/headquarters/teams-and-roles-tab-creating-user-accounts-#observer)
    user accounts and
    [API](/headquarters/survey-solutions-api)
    user accounts (in addition to supervisors and interviewers as an HQ
    user can do), change passwords for these users;
-   [set up a logo for the server and the tablets](/headquarters/admin-settings);
-   [leave a message for all of the HQ users and supervisors](/headquarters/admin-settings);
-   [password-protect downloadable data](/headquarters/admin-settings);
-   [delete a survey](/faq/deleting-a-survey)
    (questionnaire and all data);
-   unarchive a user.

Administrator is a privileged account and can do important actions which
may result in damage to data. Assign a responsible and informed person
as an administrator! We recommend that the administrator has attended a
comprehensive Survey Solutions training.  
  
Some obvious security recommendations:

-   do not share the administrator password;
-   do not forget the administrator password;
-   do not mention the administrator password in emails;
-   do not use administrator account for day-to-day HQ operations.
