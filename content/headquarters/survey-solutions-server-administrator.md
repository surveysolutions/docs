Every Survey Solutions server has an administrator:

-   **Local server** - the first user created after Survey Solutions is
    installed.
-   **Cloud server** - the credentials are sent to the client that
    [requested the
    server](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2723103-cloud-server-request?b_id=12728).

An administrator can do everything an HQ user can do plus some exclusive
actions:

-   [create
    HQ](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2482233-teams-and-roles-tab-creating-user-accounts-?b_id=12728#hqaccounts)
    user accounts,
    [observer](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2482233-teams-and-roles-tab-creating-user-accounts-?b_id=12728#observer)
    user accounts and
    [API](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2844104-survey-solutions-api)
    user accounts (in addition to supervisors and interviewers as an HQ
    user can do), change passwords for these users;
-   [set up a logo for the server and the
    tablets](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2707388-admin-settings);
-   [leave a message for all of the HQ users and
    supervisors](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2707388-admin-settings);
-   [password-protect downloadable
    data](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2707388-admin-settings);
-   [delete a
    survey](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2723119)
    (questionnaire and all data);
-   unarchive a user.

Administrator is a privileged account and can do important actions which
may result in damage to data. Assign a responsible and informed person
as an administrator! We recommend that the administrator has attended a
comprehensive Survey Solutions training.  
  
Some obvious security recommendations:

-   do not share the administrator password;
-   do not forget the administrator password;
-   do not mention the administrator password in emails;
-   do not use administrator account for day-to-day HQ operations.
