The *Teams and Roles* tab provides tools for managing the human
resources responsible for data collection—creating, editing, and
deleting user accounts for supervisors, interviewers, headquarters
(administrator), and observers (administrator).  
  
This tab also provides access to the [batch user upload
feature](/headquarters/batch-user-upload), where up to 10,000 user
accounts can be created from a single tab-delimited file. To learn more
about batch user upload, please refer to this article.  
  
 

Supervisor accounts
-------------------

  
Every survey needs supervisors. To add a supervisor, click on the *Add
supervisor* button at the top of the Supervisors tab, and enter all the
requisite information.

{{< imgproc "images/773820.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
To send an email to a user, click on the user’s email address. The
default email client setup on your computer will start to facilitate
sending emails to that user. Emails are not sent automatically and it is
up to the headquarter user to compose the message.  
  
To modify the details of an existing supervisor account, click on the
supervisor's username listed in the *Name* column, in order to perform
any of the following actions: change the password for the supervisor
account (e.g., if the password is forgotten) or lock all access to the
account (e.g., if the supervisor is fired due to poor performance).

### Archiving supervisor accounts

  
Administrators can archive supervisor accounts. By archiving a
supervisor, you are also archiving all the interviewers on that
supervisors’ team. Supervisors and their data collection team will no
longer be able to sync with headquarters.  
   
To archive a supervisor, select the check boxes for the supervisor(s)
you wish to archive and click on the red *archive* button.  
  
{{< imgproc "images/773833.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
Archived interviewer accounts can be restored. On the supervisors page,
find the archived users using the *Archive Status* filter on the right
most column. Then, select the check boxes for the supervisor(s) you wish
to restore. Lastly, click on the green *unarchive* button.   
  
  
 

Interviewer accounts
--------------------

Each supervisor needs interviewers. To add a new interviewer to a given
supervisor’s team, click on the green *Create* button under the
*Interviewer* link under the *Teams and Role* tab.  
  
{{< imgproc "images/744260.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
  
{{< imgproc "images/744261.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
  
To send an email to a user, click on the user’s email address. The
default email client setup on your computer will start to facilitate
sending emails to that user. Emails are not sent automatically and it is
up to the supervisor or the headquarter user to compose the message.  
   
To modify an interviewer’s account—change the password or lock the
account—click on the interviewer’s name.  
  
  
{{< imgproc "images/653435.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
To monitor an interviewer, check the activation status in the *Connected
to device* column and the synchronization log.  
  
{{< imgproc "images/744262.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
The *Connected to device* column displays the status of the tablet’s
activation or in other words it will show if an interviewer has
successfully activated a tablet using their login credentials.  
  
You may also manage the interviewer’s in a supervisor’s team,  by
clicking on the number of interviewers associated with that supervisor.
Under this option you can add interviewers for a given supervisor’s
team, modify their accounts, and monitor synchronization.  
  
  
Administrators can also archive individual interviewer accounts. An
interviewer will no longer be able to sync with headquarters.  
   
To archive an interviewer, select the check box associated with the
interviewer(s), then click on the red archive button. Lastly, confirm
the action.  
  
{{< imgproc "images/744269.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
{{< imgproc "images/744275.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
  
Archived interviewer accounts can be restored. On the interviewers page,
find the archived users by selecting *Archived users* on the menu on the
left hand side. Then, select the check box associated with the
interviewer(s), and click on the unarchive button at the bottom of the
page. Lastly, confirm the action.
