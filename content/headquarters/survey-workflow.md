Workflow Description
--------------------

Headquarters, designated by the PC at the top of the figure, determines
the subjects that need to be interviewed (households, firms, geographic
area, etc.) and their assignments across team supervisors. Assignments
can include one or more interview cases. Team supervisors, denoted by
the laptops in the middle, first receive these assignments and then
allocate them to the members of their team.  
  
Interviewers, represented by tablets, receive the assignments from the
team supervisors, collect data for the cases within the assignments, and
send completed cases back to supervisors for review. Team supervisors,
having received completed interview cases, review these questionnaires
to confirm that all questions are answered and that answers are
accurate, coherent, and plausible. After reviewing these completed
interview cases, team supervisors either approve or reject them.  
  
If a team supervisor approves a completed interview case received from
an interviewer, the assignment is sent to headquarters, as represented
by the paper with a checkmark. If a team supervisor rejects a completed
assignment received from an interviewer, the assignment is returned to
the interviewer initially responsible for completing it.  
  
Receiving the rejected assignment, the interviewer must either correct
it or provide explanatory notes on strange or implausible answers. When
the assignments are corrected, the interviewer sends them back to the
team supervisor for approval or rejection, a process that continues
until the assignments are completed with the highest level of quality
according to the team supervisor.  
  
As an assignment moves through the survey workflow, it takes on a
different status at each stage, as illustrated in the photo above.  
  
<span class="underline">SupervisorAssigned</span> means that
Headquarters has sent the interview assignment to the supervisor. The
supervisor must now take action on this assignment, allocating it to a
member of their team.  
   
<span class="underline">InterviewerAssigned </span>means that a
supervisor has allocated this assignment to a member of their team. The
interviewer must now conduct an interview with the assigned member of
the survey population.  
   
<span class="underline">Completed</span> means that an interviewer has
marked an interview case as complete and has sent it to the supervisor.
The supervisor must now review the questionnaire for quality and
completeness, and then reject or approve the interview.  
   
<span class="underline">RejectedBySupervisor</span> means that a
supervisor has rejected the interview and, by default, that interview
returns to the interviewer who sent it. The interviewer must now address
their supervisor’s concerns, making a change to the questionnaire or
providing explanatory comments.  
   
<span class="underline">ApprovedBySupervisor</span> means that a
supervisor has approved this interview and, in doing so, sent it
Headquarters for further review. Headquarters must now review the
interview and reject or approve it.  
   
<span class="underline">RejectedByHeadquarters</span> means that
Headquarters has rejected the interview assignment and, thus, returned
it to the supervisor that initially approved it. The concerned
supervisor must now take action on the interview, providing explanatory
comments or sending to an interviewer to be fixed.  
   
<span class="underline">ApprovedByHeadquarters</span> means that
Headquarters has approved the interview case and, no further action may
be taken on this final interview.
