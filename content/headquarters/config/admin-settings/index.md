Survey Solutions server [administrator](/headquarters/accounts/survey-solutions-server-administrator/)
may adjust the server settings. These settings affect simultaneously all surveys
and all users in a particular workspace on the server and have the effect
immediately when applied.

These settings are visible only to the user logged in in an administrative role
and can be accessed from: `Menu` &#x2192; `Administration` &#x2192; `Settings`.

### Export Encryption

This group of settings contains settings that control the encryption of the data
archive produced when exporting the data from Survey Solutions.

When `enable encryption` checkbox is checked, the produced data zip-archive will
be encrypted with a password that the administrator sees in the settings. To
ensure high level of security the password can't be typed in, but is generated
using a random password generation algorithm to make sure the password is
sufficiently complex. The administrator may request a different password to be
generated by pressing the circular arrows button. There is no way of setting a
specific password in this field.

**Default = disabled**

The field `password` must be populated with a valid password for encryption to
take effect. There is no default password. To ensure the password is strong,
the program generates one automatically. A new password can be generated by
clicking on the refresh button.

### Global Note

This group of settings contains only one setting that controls the server global
note. When specified, the global note will be shown at every page for every user
logged into the Survey Solutions Server.

**Default = empty**

- To specify the global note - specify a new note and click `save`.

You will see a message `Note saved` on successful update or deletion of the
global note.

### Interviewer/Supervisor application settings

This group contains the Interviewer/Supervisor application settings
centrally controlled from the server by the administrator.

version of the App (as installed on the server) may be utilized by
the workforce to exchange data with the server.

Solutions as installed on the server, set the checkbox to checked
state.

earlier versions of Survey Solutions, set the checkbox to unchecked
state.

This setting is only a recommendation. If Survey Solutions determines
that e.g. the newly imported questionnaire has features not supported
by the version installed on the interviewer's tablet, it will still
require to update.

The checkbox `Enable notifications on device` controls whether the
[notifications](/interviewer/app/app-notifications/) will be issued
for interviewers during their work on the tablets.

**default = on**

Numeric parameter `Geography question accuracy` sets the requested accuracy
(in meters) for geography-type  questions with automatic and semi-automatic
measurement. It accepts integer values from 1m to 1,000m.

**default = 10**

Numeric parameter `Geography question period` regulates how frequently the
points will be recorded in a geography-type question by setting up the period
between the recordings of the points. The period is measured in seconds. Any
value from 5 to 1,000 may be specified.

**default = 10**

### Web interview settings

The checkbox `Web interview email notifications` controls whether respondents
to web surveys may request an email with a link to resume the interview if the
interview session gets interrupted.

The email with the resume link is only sent when a
[bulk email service provider](/headquarters/cawi/email-providers/)
is set up, otherwise it is not sent out even if this checkbox is checked.

  to checked state.
