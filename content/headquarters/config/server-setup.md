This article describes the main steps to setup your own 
Survey Solutions server.

- Study the [requirements for a server](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/faq/server-requirements/). 
These requirements are minimal and may be periodically revised. 
Your survey may require a different hardware configuration.
You may need to calibrate for a few months before the survey
to determine the optimal configuration.

- Follow the [installation instructions](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/standalone-installation/)
to install the prerequisites and the Survey Solutions itself. 

- The installation file for survey solutions may be obtained 
from the Downloads section of the 
[self-service portal](https://mysurvey.solutions). There is 
only one installation set regardless where you want to install: 
to a physical server or a cloud-based server.

- Your network firewall or security software may need to
be configured to permit Survey Solutions. See 
[#3 in the FAQ](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/getting-started/faq-for-it-personnel/).

- Your backup system may need to be configured to cover
the Survey Solutions data.

After the installation and configuration of your server 
follow the Survey Solutions release notifications and
update your server periodically. You decide yourself on
the frequency of the backups, updates and other maintenance
that you do on your server.
