A Standalone Survey Solutions Server is any server where 
Survey Solutions is installed outside of the  
facilities managed by the Survey Solutions developers 
team.

The following articles describe the main points that you
would need to know before you setup your server.

- Study the [requirements for a local server](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/faq/server-requirements/). These
requirements are minimal and may be periodically revised. 
Your survey may require a different hardware configuration.
You may need to calibrate for a few months before the survey
to determine the optimal configuration.

- Submit a [request for a local server](https://mysurvey.solutions/NewServerRequest).
This is similar to
[requesting a cloud server](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/faq/cloud-server-request/),
but keep in mind that you will need to specify a public (external)
fixed IP address of your server when you fill out the request. To
find your public IP address, [click here](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip)
or [here](https://www.myip.com/).

- Follow the [installation instructions](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/standalone-installation/)
to install the prerequisites and the Survey Solutions itself. The installation
file for survey solutions may be obtained from the Downloads 
section of the [self-service portal](https://mysurvey.solutions)
after your request for a local server is approved. The 
local installation requires the request to be submitted and
approved (previous step).

- Your network firewall or security software may need to
be configured to permit Survey Solutions. See [#3 in the FAQ](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/getting-started/faq-for-it-personnel/).

- Your backup system may need to be configured to cover
the Survey Solutions data.

After the installation and configuration of your server 
follow the Survey Solutions release notifications and
update your server periodically.
