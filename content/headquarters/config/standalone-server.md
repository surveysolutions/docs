A Standalone Survey Solutions Server is any server where 
Survey Solutions is installed outside of the  
facilities managed by the Survey Solutions developers 
team.

The following articles describe the main points that you
would need to know before you setup your server.

- Study the [requirements for a local server](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/faq/server-requirements/). These
requirements are minimal and may be periodically revised. 
Your survey may require a different hardware configuration.
You may need to calibrate for a few months before the survey
to determine the optimal configuration.

- Your server must have a fixed public IP address (aka static 
external IP address). To find your public IP address, you can 
use [this tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip)
or [that tool](https://www.myip.com/).

- To be able to import questionnaires from the Survey Solutions 
Designer to your server connect your server by submitting the 
following [form](https://mysurvey.solutions/NewServerRequest).

- Follow the [installation instructions](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/standalone-installation/)
to install the prerequisites and the Survey Solutions itself. 

- The installation file for survey solutions may be obtained 
from the Downloads section of the [self-service portal](https://mysurvey.solutions). 

- Your network firewall or security software may need to
be configured to permit Survey Solutions. See [#3 in the FAQ](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/getting-started/faq-for-it-personnel/).

- Your backup system may need to be configured to cover
the Survey Solutions data.

After the installation and configuration of your server 
follow the Survey Solutions release notifications and
update your server periodically.
