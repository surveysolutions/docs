If you forget your password for the demo server, you can reset it, by right-clicking the server name, and selecting the `Request password reset` menu item in the [self-service portal](https://pds.mysurvey.solutions). The new password will be automatically generated and sent to your email. The older password will no longer be valid.

If you wish to remove the personal demonstration server (with all content) earlier than 30 days after it was created, select the corresponding `Remove server` option. Otherwise it will ceise to exist at the due date automatically.
