You can access existing content of the demo server as an [observer user](/headquarters/accounts/survey-solutions-server-observer/), by signing in with the username `DemoObs` and password `MjQ4zUaFe9`.

It is correct that the password for this account is exposed, and specifically on this page, but this is exactly the intension to let the users log in.<BR>
<I>(Password for this account can't be changed at the demo server since it has been declared as a <A href="/headquarters/accounts/restricted-account/">restricted user account</A>)</I><BR>

We also provide miniature sandbox-like PDS ([Personal Demo Servers](/headquarters/config/personal-demo-server/)). 
With a PDS you get control over the administrator account, and can create multiple other accounts in different roles to:

- explore the interface of the software,
- check which functionality is available in different roles,
- test pre-loading data files,
- try the Survey Solutions API,
- see the new features added in a [recent release](/release-notes/).

⚠️ To set up your own server for real data collection read the following [instructions](/headquarters/config/server-setup/).
