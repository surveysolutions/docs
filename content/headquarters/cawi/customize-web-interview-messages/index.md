Web interviews conducted with Survey Solutions contain reasonable
default messages suitable for many surveys. But if the default messages
are not suitable for a certain purpose, they can be customized in the
web survey setup dialog at the Survey Solutions Headquarters:  
  
![Editing custom text messages for web interviews](images/866690.png)  
  
For every parameter select if you wish to display a built-in default
message, or a custom one, and if so, provide your custom (formatted)
text of such a message. You can use the formatting toolbar provided in
the editor to adjust the font color and font attributes, include
numbered and bullet lists, and include hyperlinks.
