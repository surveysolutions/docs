Early versions of Survey Solutions allowed you to collect data in two modes

-   Census mode
-   and Sample mode

These modes are now superceded by assignments, that allow implementing more flexible behavior.
  
If you have a list of the households, enterprises or persons that your
enumerators are going to interview, your best choice is the ***Sample
mode***. On the other hand, if you are not sure whom you are going to be
interviewing (for example during an exit poll) or you would like to list
or survey all the households from a particular area (for example during
a census), you should choose the ***Census mode***.  
   
The set-up procedure for Census mode differs slightly from launching a
survey with Sample mode.  Most importantly, the census mode does not
require any sample definition file.  You also do not have to assign
cases to individual supervisors and interviewers—the census mode
questionnaires will be available to every user registered with your
*headquarter system (HQ)*.
