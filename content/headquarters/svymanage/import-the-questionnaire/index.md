A questionnaire document prepared in the Designer site needs to be imported
to the Survey Solutions data server before the data collection may start in
that survey. This article outlines how to import a questionnaire from the
Designer to the HQ.

🛈 The questionnaire import operation is available to users in HQ or
administrator roles.

1. In the main menu select `Survey setup`, then `Questionnaires`.

2. Click the `Import questionnaire` button.

3. Enter the Designer credentials under which you've designed your questionnaire.

4. Select the questionnaire that you want to import from the list. The list of
questionnaires shows the questionnaires owned by you and shared with you
together. You can navigate the pages, search the questionnaires and sort them
by title, date of last modification, or owner.

5. Once the questionnaire is selected, type an import comment, which is a
memo to yourself and colleagues working in HQ regarding this survey or
version of the questionnaire.

After the questionnaire is imported it will appear in the list of the
questionnaires in the `Survey Setup` → `Questionnaires` page.

🛈 Only questionnaires without compilation errors may be imported from the
Designer to the data server. If your questionnaire contains any errors, they
must be corrected first in the Designer tool.

🛈 If you've made any changes to a questionnaire in the Designer, these changes
do not affect the questionnaires imported to the data server. To take advantage
of those changes the questionnaire must be imported again.
