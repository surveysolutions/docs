The headquarters software is a suite of connected tools for the
administrator and headquarters users:  
 

-   to track the overall progress of the survey
    ([Reports](/headquarters/reports-tab-track-the-overall-progress-of-the-survey))
-   to review completed interviews
    ([Interviews](/headquarters/interview-tab-how-to-find-review-and-delete-survey-cases-))
-   to manage the human resources ([Teams and
    Roles](/headquarters/teams-and-roles-tab-creating-user-accounts-))
-   to specify survey instruments, create survey assignments with those
    instruments([Survey
    Setup](/headquarters/survey-setup-tab-import-copy-and-delete-questionnaire-templates-and-create-assignments))
-   to export the data collected from these assignments ([Data
    Export](/headquarters/data-export-tab))
-   to find a check the status of particular case assignments
    ([Troubleshooting](/headquarters/troubleshooting-page))

  
  
The difference between the headquarters and administrator users is that
the administrator can create headquarters/observer user accounts,
archive user accounts, and delete questionnaire templates from the
headquarters server.  
  
The articles linked here will provide an overview of each tool—
