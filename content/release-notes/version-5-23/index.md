Improved reports
----------------

### New reports

#### Status Duration

While most reports show survey progress, the Status Duration report
carefully flags lack of progress. By seeing how many days interviews
stay in the same status, survey managers can see whether survey
operations are moving forward, and identify any bottlenecks (e.g., slow
approval by supervisors, slower reactions by HQ, etc.) .By clicking on
any cell in the report, managers can drill down to the details of which
questionnaires and/or field staff are behind interviews stagnating in
the same status.

#### Devices/Interviewers

{{< imgproc "images/813575.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
Troubleshooting can be hard. To make this difficult task somewhat
easier, the Devices/Interviewers report compiles information on
potential problems—failures to sync with the server (NEVER CONNECTED),
oversights in updating Interviewer (OLD VERSION), and problems in tablet
settings (WRONG TIME ON TABLET), etc.. From this report on all
interviewers, survey (IT) managers can easily navigate, with a click, to
more detailed reports on an individual interviewer’s sync history and
tablet info.

### Facility for exporting reports to XLS, CSV, and TAB formats

{{< imgproc "images/813576.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
Even if you have moved to CAPI, your bosses or clients may still want
paper reports. To make traditional reporting easier, all tables on the
Reports tab can now be exported to XLSX, CSV, or TAB format. From that
format, you can easily include them in status updates to internal and
external clients. To export, navigate to the bottom right of the report,
and click on the desired download format.

### Overall improvements

All reports have been given a modern look and feel. Column headers can
be clicked to sort most reports. Rows, thanks to alternating dark and
light lines, are easier to read.

Most reports have headers with totals, making management of surveys with
several survey instruments easier.

Many reports have more straightforward controls. All filters have
clearer names. Some filters, like those for the Quantity and Speed
reports, have been organized in a more intuitive order.

Other improvements
------------------

### Improved interface for the Interviews tab in Headquarters/Supervisor

More than a simple makeover, the improvements to the Interviews tab are
more functional than aesthetic.

First, Interviews have a new action menu. Upon (left-) clicking on any
interview, the Headquarters or Supervisor user will see a menu of
actions available.

Second, some of the menu actions are new actions. The Show Status
History option shows a status report for the selected interview in
clear, compact format—showing what status change occurred (STATE), when
it happened (CHANGED ON), who initiated the change (BY), who picked up
the interview (ASSIGNED TO) , and some optional notes on why the change
occurred (COMMENTS).

The Open responsible’s profile option takes the user to a detailed
report on the interviewer’s recent synchronization activity, connection
statistics, and detailed device info.

### Other assorted improvements

These include:

-   **Localization of the web interview user interface into French,
    Spanish, and Arabic.** This will allow those who complete
    questionnaires online the same ease of navigation that interviewers
    have on the tablet. Stay tuned for more localization.
-   **Interview key exported.** In version 5.20, the interview key—a
    short, unique interview identifier—appeared in Headquarters and
    Supervisor. In this version, that key is being exported along with
    other survey data. In another version very soon, the interview key
    will be visible to interviewers as well. This will allow all quick
    identification of survey cases, avoiding vague references to the
    household head’s name or overly precise provision of all identifying
    information.
-   **Performance improvements and bug fixes.** In addition to the
    visible features are continued improvements to the performance of
    all components of Survey Solutions.
