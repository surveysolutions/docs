-   New language for validation and skip conditions: Now, Survey
    Solutions can validate data using algorithms of arbitrary
    complexity. You will appreciate the simplicity and flexibility of
    new functionality for writing validations and conditions for rosters
    and groups; string functions for validating text questions;
    functions that calculates distances between GPS coordinates, data
    and time functions, and hundreds other functions and methods.
-   Extension of Data Export functionality: we removed the limitation
    that only a HQ approved questionnaires can be exported. Now, any
    questionnaire on a HQ or Supervisor, regardless of its status, can
    be exported.
-   Tab-delimited format for preloading, batch operations, and long
    lists: Survey Solutions is now using tab-delimited format for
    preloading, batch operations, and filling the long lists in the
    single choice and cascading questions. The Tab-delimited format can
    handle better the local scripts and punctuations.
-   We also made some changes in the user interface on a tablet, fixed
    bugs and optimized Survey Solutions for better performance.
