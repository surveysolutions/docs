Next to multiple improvements in user interface and stability of the
software, we have introduced a seven new features:

-   **Listing mode.** While conducting a listing or a census, your
    enumerator will be able to dynamically add new households to the
    set. However, just like with any other survey, such submissions will
    still be subject to supervisor's approval.
-   **"Nested" rosters.** From now on, you can "nest" rostersâ€”that is,
    include rosters within rosters (within rosters..., etc.). For
    example, each row of the household members rosters can include a
    subsequent roster listing person's assets. Additionally, the
    questions can now include the tag "%rostertitle%", which will be
    dynamically replaced by the relevant row header.
-   **Offline supervisor.** Teams that work in the field without
    connection to the internet can now start using the offline
    supervisor dashboard, installed directly on the supervisors'
    laptops. Enumerators and supervisors will able to exchange data
    using the local network; the information will be uploaded to the
    headquarters once the internet connection is available.
-   **Data preloading.** Survey Solutions makes it possible to
    "pre-load" data into all fields, including the rosters. Such
    information can be then edited or deleted by the enumerator. The
    function makes it simple to, for example, upload and verify data
    from previous panel waves.
-   **Map report.** GPS data gathered with Survey Solutions can now be
    plotted on a map (using Google Maps imagery: both the street map and
    the aerial/satellite imagery). In that way, the headquarters users
    can instantly see where the data have been gathered.
-   **QR Codes.** The enumerators will be able to scan both
    two-dimensional QR codes and ordinary barcodes. Their contents (e.g.
    a serial number) will be stored with your data set.
-   **API**. You can now built your own application on top of the data
    gathered with Survey Solutions, as the current version adds the
    support for a JSON-based Application Programming Interface. The API
    will allow you to create dynamic dashboards, visualizations or
    export the data to custom formats (e.g. SQL-like databases).
