A new, responsive user interface has been introduced to the Headquarters
and Supervisor consoles, making it easier to quickly add new supervisors
and interviewers and match them to single or multiple households (or
other interview assignments). We have also rolled out further
performance improvements: downloading 1000 questionnaires to a tablet
device takes only 8 minutes; uploading 1000 completed questionnaires to
a cloud server takes 30 minutes. The supervisor console can handle over
10,000 submissions and generate statistics without noticeable delays.
