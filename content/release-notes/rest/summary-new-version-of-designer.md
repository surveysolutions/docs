Substantial changes have been introduced to the Questionnaire Designer:

Additionally, we have introduced the possibility of importing large
batches of addresses to be visited by the interviewers from a CSV file.

-   The application makes a more efficient use of the screen size, while
    new tool tips provide contextual help to the users;
-   The SingleOption and MultiOption questions are now called
    “Categorical: one answer” and “Categorical: multiple answers”;
-   Adding a new option to a categorical question is much easier—it can
    now be done with one click and does not require any further
    confirmation;
-   The “Export to PDF” function has been redesigned. The PDF files
    generated by the system now feature a cover page, distinguish
    between different types of questions and include the condition and
    validation expressions
