The latest version of WB CAPI introduces two new types of rosters. In
addition to the standard type of roster, connected to an integer-type
question determining the number of rows to be displayed, WB CAPI now
supports:

-   **Fixed rosters.** Such a roster can be defined by simply providing
    a static list of row headers.
-   **Rosters connected to multiple-choice questions.** In this case, a
    roster will be created with rows representing every option selected
    in a multiple-choice question. This feature is especially useful in
    income and consumption surveys, where the respondent can be first
    asked to select the products consumed from a list, in order to,
    subsequently, fill in a consumption roster specifying quantities and
    units.

Additionally, the process of selecting roster row headers has been made
easier and more intuitive. The release also contains a number of bug
fixes and measures improving stability of the application.
