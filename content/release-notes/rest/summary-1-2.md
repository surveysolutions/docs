Features added in the release include:

-   **Questionnaire compiler/verifier.** After editing your
    questionnaire in the Questionnaire Designer, you can instantly check
    if the skip patterns or validation expressions you have entered are
    correct. Our verifier will warn you when wrong syntax, references to
    nonexistent variables or other design errors are detected.
-   **Smarter "select multiple"-type questions.** While creating
    categorical questions with multiple answers possible, questionnaire
    designers have more options. They can limit the number of answers
    (E.g. "select the three most important reasons...") and ask the
    respondents to order them, for example indicating their preferences.
