This release, next to bug fixes and stability improvements, introduces:

-   **New question type: list.** Lists can be used to collect up to 40
    lines of text, for example to names gather of household members.
-   **New roster type.** The new list-type questions can also be
    connected to roster, where each list entry will correspond to one
    roster row.
-   **Groups enclosed in rosters.** Every roster can now include a
    nested group of questions, which helps organize roster data entry
    more efficiently.
-   **Faster data export.** Saving the survey results in .csv and
    tab-separated file formats takes less time and resources.
