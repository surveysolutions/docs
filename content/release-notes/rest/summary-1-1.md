The CAPI team is constantly working on adding new features. This release
(1.1) has included various fixes that improve the stability and
responsiveness of the Designer and Interviewer software. In addition to
that, the release includes support for:

-   **Name substitution.** The text of a question displayed to the
    interviewer can now include the answers to one or more of the other
    questions. For example, if the answer to the question about the
    interviewee's name is "Tom", a question about the job that follows
    can be automatically updated to "What is Tom's job?";
-   **Supervisor questions.** Certain questions can be marked as
    answered only by supervisors. This feature might be helpful when
    more experienced supervisors are expect to assign codes to answers
    given to the interviewers in a narrative form;
-   **Decimal fractions** in numeric questions. Questionnaire designer
    can freely select the number's precision.

The release also contains various **user interfact improvements**, such
as displaying the name of the interviewer on the dashboard of the tablet
app.
