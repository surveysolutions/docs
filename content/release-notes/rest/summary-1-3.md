This release features:

-   **Questionnaire tester.** A new application allows Questionnaire
    Designers to easily test their questionnaires on an Android device,
    helping them ensure that skip patterns and validation expressions
    are correct.
-   **Easier management of rosters.** "Autopropagated groups" changed
    their name to "roster". A roster can now be created by connecting a
    group to any integer question.
