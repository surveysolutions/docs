This release, next to bug fixes and stability improvements, introduces:

-   **New Questionnaire Designer.** New user interface improves
    performance and makes it easier to move questions or groups across
    chapters.
-   **Static text field.** Messages to the enumerator, consent forms and
    other types of text information that are not normally considered a
    part of the question can be included in the questionnaire as "static
    text fields".
-   **Custom labels.** Users can customize the variable label exported
    to Stata.
-   **Masked entry.** Questionnaire designers can set specific data
    format for text fields that the application will enforce, for
    example phone or national ID numbers.
-   **Enhanced export.** CSV export now includes interview status
    changes, responsible supervisors and enumerators, as well as
    interview durations.
-   **Thousands separators.** A comma will group thousands together when
    entering a large number into a numeric field.
-   **Batch operations.** "Select all" button will allow HQ users and
    supervisors to assign or delete interviews in a batch.
-   **New map report.** After clicking a pin on the map, the system will
    display basic information about the interview (responsible staff
    member, interview status), as well as a link to the complete
    interview record.
