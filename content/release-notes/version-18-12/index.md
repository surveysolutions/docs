Dear friends of Survey Solutions,

In the v18.12, we released on December 4th, 2018 we introduced the following improvements:

- An extra level of data encryption on tablets comparable and exceeding industry standards for data security (request from RTI and other users).
- Support for audio, video and PDF files in attachments (request from Klaus Bass and UCSF)
- Heat map overlay in Map reports and improvements in processing maps with more than 50,000 coordinates
- A global flag to hide disabled questions on Designer (request from Michael Wild)
- Ability for users to set up default value for the date question (request from Phany (SA) and other users)
- New report on data traffic usage with total amount of traffic consumed by Survey Solutions (request from SPC and many other users)
 

We also fixed bugs and improved the following functionality:

 

1. Enabling conditions are now shown for sections and sub-sections in the PDF preview. (reported by Elena Moroz)

2. Unification of the calculation of speed report between the HQ and the supervisor.

3. Harmonization of the exported data - variable and value labels added where they were missing, order of variables in the exported data changed, etc. (reported and requested by Andreas Kutka).

 

A detailed description of the new features introduced in version 18.12 can be accessed here.

 

In the next release of Survey Solutions, version 19.2, we plan to introduce new representation of multi-select and single-select questions, improve reporting for questionnaires with many versions, extend types of rosters, and add several new major features that we are sure will excite you.

 

We also would like to inform you that we have changed our release schedule. Starting from version 18.12, we have a major release every two months and a minor release one month after the start of the two month sprint. In that, the next major release is scheduled for the first week of February 2019, while the minor release is scheduled for the first week of January 2019. The minor releases will be deployed only to the users who requested new servers after the minor release date or on request; all other servers will be upgraded only with the major released versions.     

 

Thank you for supporting the Survey Solutions project!

 

Development Team.
