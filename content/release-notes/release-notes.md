### Survey Solutions 2.2

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">August 6, 2014</span>

This release, next to bug fixes and stability improvements, introduces:

-   **New Questionnaire Designer.** New user interface improves
    performance and makes it easier to move questions or groups across
    chapters.
-   **Static text field.** Messages to the enumerator, consent forms and
    other types of text information that are not normally considered a
    part of the question can be included in the questionnaire as "static
    text fields".
-   **Custom labels.** Users can customize the variable label exported
    to Stata.
-   **Masked entry.** Questionnaire designers can set specific data
    format for text fields that the application will enforce, for
    example phone or national ID numbers.
-   **Enhanced export.** CSV export now includes interview status
    changes, responsible supervisors and enumerators, as well as
    interview durations.
-   **Thousands separators.** A comma will group thousands together when
    entering a large number into a numeric field.
-   **Batch operations.** "Select all" button will allow HQ users and
    supervisors to assign or delete interviews in a batch.
-   **New map report.** After clicking a pin on the map, the system will
    display basic information about the interview (responsible staff
    member, interview status), as well as a link to the complete
    interview record.

### Survey Solutions 2.0

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">May 23, 2014</span>

Next to multiple improvements in user interface and stability of the
software, we have introduced a seven new features:

-   **Listing mode.** While conducting a listing or a census, your
    enumerator will be able to dynamically add new households to the
    set. However, just like with any other survey, such submissions will
    still be subject to supervisor's approval.
-   **"Nested" rosters.** From now on, you can "nest" rosters—that is,
    include rosters within rosters (within rosters..., etc.). For
    example, each row of the household members rosters can include a
    subsequent roster listing person's assets. Additionally, the
    questions can now include the tag "%rostertitle%", which will be
    dynamically replaced by the relevant row header.
-   **Offline supervisor.** Teams that work in the field without
    connection to the internet can now start using the offline
    supervisor dashboard, installed directly on the supervisors'
    laptops. Enumerators and supervisors will able to exchange data
    using the local network; the information will be uploaded to the
    headquarters once the internet connection is available.
-   **Data preloading.** Survey Solutions makes it possible to
    "pre-load" data into all fields, including the rosters. Such
    information can be then edited or deleted by the enumerator. The
    function makes it simple to, for example, upload and verify data
    from previous panel waves.
-   **Map report.** GPS data gathered with Survey Solutions can now be
    plotted on a map (using Google Maps imagery: both the street map and
    the aerial/satellite imagery). In that way, the headquarters users
    can instantly see where the data have been gathered.
-   **QR Codes.** The enumerators will be able to scan both
    two-dimensional QR codes and ordinary barcodes. Their contents (e.g.
    a serial number) will be stored with your data set.
-   **API**. You can now built your own application on top of the data
    gathered with Survey Solutions, as the current version adds the
    support for a JSON-based Application Programming Interface. The API
    will allow you to create dynamic dashboards, visualizations or
    export the data to custom formats (e.g. SQL-like databases).

### WB CAPI 1.6

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">February 4, 2014</span>

This release, next to bug fixes and stability improvements, introduces:

-   **New question type: list.** Lists can be used to collect up to 40
    lines of text, for example to names gather of household members.
-   **New roster type.** The new list-type questions can also be
    connected to roster, where each list entry will correspond to one
    roster row.
-   **Groups enclosed in rosters.** Every roster can now include a
    nested group of questions, which helps organize roster data entry
    more efficiently.
-   **Faster data export.** Saving the survey results in .csv and
    tab-separated file formats takes less time and resources.

### WB CAPI 1.5

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">January 14, 2014</span>

The latest version of WB CAPI introduces two new types of rosters. In
addition to the standard type of roster, connected to an integer-type
question determining the number of rows to be displayed, WB CAPI now
supports:

-   **Fixed rosters.** Such a roster can be defined by simply providing
    a static list of row headers.
-   **Rosters connected to multiple-choice questions.** In this case, a
    roster will be created with rows representing every option selected
    in a multiple-choice question. This feature is especially useful in
    income and consumption surveys, where the respondent can be first
    asked to select the products consumed from a list, in order to,
    subsequently, fill in a consumption roster specifying quantities and
    units.

Additionally, the process of selecting roster row headers has been made
easier and more intuitive. The release also contains a number of bug
fixes and measures improving stability of the application.

### WB CAPI 1.4

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">December 9, 2013</span>

This release includes bug fixes and performance improvements.

### WB CAPI 1.3

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">November 20, 2013</span>

This release features:

-   **Questionnaire tester.** A new application allows Questionnaire
    Designers to easily test their questionnaires on an Android device,
    helping them ensure that skip patterns and validation expressions
    are correct.
-   **Easier management of rosters.** "Autopropagated groups" changed
    their name to "roster". A roster can now be created by connecting a
    group to any integer question.

### WB CAPI 1.2

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">November 1, 2013</span>

Features added in the release include:

-   **Questionnaire compiler/verifier.** After editing your
    questionnaire in the Questionnaire Designer, you can instantly check
    if the skip patterns or validation expressions you have entered are
    correct. Our verifier will warn you when wrong syntax, references to
    nonexistent variables or other design errors are detected.
-   **Smarter "select multiple"-type questions.** While creating
    categorical questions with multiple answers possible, questionnaire
    designers have more options. They can limit the number of answers
    (E.g. "select the three most important reasons...") and ask the
    respondents to order them, for example indicating their preferences.

### WB CAPI 1.1

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">October 20, 2013</span>

The CAPI team is constantly working on adding new features. This release
(1.1) has included various fixes that improve the stability and
responsiveness of the Designer and Interviewer software. In addition to
that, the release includes support for:

-   **Name substitution.** The text of a question displayed to the
    interviewer can now include the answers to one or more of the other
    questions. For example, if the answer to the question about the
    interviewee's name is "Tom", a question about the job that follows
    can be automatically updated to "What is Tom's job?";
-   **Supervisor questions.** Certain questions can be marked as
    answered only by supervisors. This feature might be helpful when
    more experienced supervisors are expect to assign codes to answers
    given to the interviewers in a narrative form;
-   **Decimal fractions** in numeric questions. Questionnaire designer
    can freely select the number's precision.

The release also contains various **user interfact improvements**, such
as displaying the name of the interviewer on the dashboard of the tablet
app.

### Official release of WB CAPI

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">September 30, 2013</span>

The World Bank's software for computer-assisted personal interviewing
(CAPI) has been officially released. Using the web-based editor, users
around the world can build their own questionnaires that will be used to
gather data with Android-based tablet devices. The official release
comes with a set of new features:

-   Linked questions give the possibility to e.g. precisely map
    different kinds of relationships within a household by allowing to
    select answers to a categorical questions from within a roster list;
-   CAPI can collect GPS coordinates, supported in the new question
    type: Geolocation;
-   Interview assignments that have not been yet completed can be
    deleted by the headquarters user

### New version of Questionnaire Designer; the Headquarters console supports bulk uploading of interview assignments

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">August 7, 2013</span>

Substantial changes have been introduced to the Questionnaire Designer:

Additionally, we have introduced the possibility of importing large
batches of addresses to be visited by the interviewers from a CSV file.

-   The application makes a more efficient use of the screen size, while
    new tool tips provide contextual help to the users;
-   The SingleOption and MultiOption questions are now called
    “Categorical: one answer” and “Categorical: multiple answers”;
-   Adding a new option to a categorical question is much easier—it can
    now be done with one click and does not require any further
    confirmation;
-   The “Export to PDF” function has been redesigned. The PDF files
    generated by the system now feature a cover page, distinguish
    between different types of questions and include the condition and
    validation expressions

### New interface and further performance improvements

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">July 29, 2013</span>

A new, responsive user interface has been introduced to the Headquarters
and Supervisor consoles, making it easier to quickly add new supervisors
and interviewers and match them to single or multiple households (or
other interview assignments). We have also rolled out further
performance improvements: downloading 1000 questionnaires to a tablet
device takes only 8 minutes; uploading 1000 completed questionnaires to
a cloud server takes 30 minutes. The supervisor console can handle over
10,000 submissions and generate statistics without noticeable delays.

### Performance improvements

<span style="float: right; padding-top: 20px;">July 22, 2013</span>

Synchronization of the data between tablet devices and the server is now
faster; thousands of completed questionnaires can be uploaded within
minutes. The system handles broken internet connections more robustly
and without data loss. The tablet application displays a gauge measuring
the synchronization process.

Questionnaire Designer users can now make their questionnaires public
(available to other users).

Project background
------------------

The CAPI project started in early 2012 in cooperation with the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation, the Living Standards Measurement
Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture team and the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Initially, the client
software was produced for Microsoft Windows 7-based Tablet PCs; at the
same time first versions of the Survey Management System (the server
software) have been released.

The project, however, coincided with massive changes to Microsoft
Windows-powered tablet devices. Windows RT, the successor of the tablet
version of Windows 7 that was launched in September 2012, has not
preserved backward software compatibility. Consequently, applications
written specifically for Windows 7, such as the CAPI client, would not
work on the newer devices

At the same time, the market share of basic Android tablet devices kept
growing, especially among low-cost devices that could be purchased also
by austere governments or from shoestring research budget. As a result,
our team decided to concentrate its efforts on developing an
Android-based client, with the possibility of extending the support to
other platforms at a later stage.

The change in the chosen platform led to postponing the implementation
of certain features, as the attention of the developers was focused on
producing the new version of the client. Given that, the first pilot
survey using the CAPI system was started only in March 2013 in St.
Lucia.
