Survey deletion is possible, but as a dangerous operation is made
available only to server administrators. When a survey is deleted all
data collected as part of that survey is irretrievably and irreversibly
lost. Hence the same steps should be applied as described in [actions
after the end of the
survey](/faq/actions-after-the-end-of-the-survey).  
  
Make sure you backup your data before deleting a survey! Even if this
was training, pre-test, or a field test. In some cases even data
collected as part of such exercises can be invaluable for improving the
questionnaire, estimating the performance of interviewers, or duration
of the survey.  
  
There is rarely any need to delete a survey. [Deleting a questionnaire
template](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2488930)
will delete the whole survey with all data associated with it. In most
cases a new server instance should be requested to allow the
installation of the most recent version of the Survey Solutions server
components.
