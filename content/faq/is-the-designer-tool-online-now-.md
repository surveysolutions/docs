The Survey Solutions Designer tool is a web-based tool and is accessible
over the Internet. As with any website, when you can't use the site, it
could be:

- a problem with the site,
- a problem with connection, or
- a problem with your own device.

In order to identify if the problem is with the site or related
specifically to you, other devices can be used to try accessing the same
site. There are many services of this kind in the Internet, which by
probing from multiple IPs can conclude whether the site is up and
running, experiencing significant delays, or is working fine.  

Before reporting that any of the sites (Survey Solutions cloud server or
Designer, etc) are "*not working*" verify it with one or more of the
tools below.

We watch the report generated by UptimeRobot [here](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/XKpm1cBvww) for our main sites.

Other tools may be used to check if the site is available, for example,
from your region. Please note that neither the World Bank Group, nor the
Survey Solutions developers are in any way affiliated with these
services, listed below in no particular order:

Or use other tools of this kind that can provide an objective measure of
the availability of the resource. If the tools above indicate that the
site is available, but you still can't reach it, please contact ***your***
system or network administrator who will be able to help resolve the
situation.
