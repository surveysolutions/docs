>Q: I am trying to access the website <TT>https://solutions.worldbank.org</TT>,
but it shows an error. What do I need to do?

A: In the past, the address <TT>https://solutions.worldbank.org</TT> has led to
the **Designer** tool from the Survey Solutions tool set. Now the Designer is
accessible from this page: <TT>https://designer.mysurvey.solutions</TT>.

Some older presentations or instructions guides may still refer to the older
address if they were not updated in the meanwhile.
