>Q: I am trying to access the website https://solutions.worldbank.org but it shows an error. What do I need to do?

A: In the past, the address https://solutions.worldbank.org has led to the **Designer** tool from the Survey Solutions tool set. Now the Designer is accessible from this page: https://designer.mysurvey.solutions

Some older presentations or instructions guides may still refer to the older address if they were not updated in the meanwhile.
