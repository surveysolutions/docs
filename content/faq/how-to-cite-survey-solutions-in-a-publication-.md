Please note, that `CAPI` (<U>C</U>omputer <U>A</U>ssisted <U>P</U>ersonal <U>I</U>nterviewing) is a technology, which is implemented in many and diverse software packages. A reference to *CAPI* helps identify the technology (as opposed to e.g. paper-based data collection), but not a specific program or package utilized in data collection. *CAPI technology* [dates back to at least 1980s](https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2003/pdf/st030330.pdf) and certainly predates Survey Solutions.
