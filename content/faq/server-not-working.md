Occasionally our users receive messages from their interviewers
that a certain server "*...is not working*". In most cases this 
is a problem with the user's equipment used to access the server, 
rather than the server itself.  
  
The following tools may be helpful in determining whether it is 
indeed a problem with the server or with a specific user's device 
trying to access that server:

- <https://isitdownorjust.me/demo-mysurvey-solutions/>
- <https://www.site24x7.com/check-website-availability.html>  
- <http://www.freesitestatus.com/en/quicktest.php>  
- any other alternative tool of this kind.

*These are the third-party tools and we neither produce, nor provide 
any training or support related to these tools.*  
  
If the above tools indicate that the server is functional, then the
problem is likely in the device (physical or software configuration, 
settings) or the connectivity (reliability of the connection lines, 
signal strength or security mechanisms and protocols present in your
network).
  
If you are reporting a problem with a demo server or a personal demo 
server (PDS) please include into your report <span class="underline">
**the information according to the [ORANGE checklist](/faq/issue-reporting/#orange)**</span>.

Specifying all of this information will expedite the handling of
the issue. If any of this information is missing, we may need to contact
you to obtain it, which will delay the troubleshooting.  
  
Occasionally we perform **servers maintenance**, which may involve
rebooting the server(s) and hence a brief interruption in service. These
operations are rare and usually completed within a 15-minute period. If
you are experiencing a server access issue, kindly make sure you have
allowed at least 20 minutes to elapse, and retried before submitting the
server access problem report.  
  
If the problem is related to the server that is not managed by our team,
please contact the corresponding server administrator. Correspondingly,
if the server is hosted in a cloud, contact the corresponding cloud 
provider, who will be able to assist you further.
