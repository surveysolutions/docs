Survey Solutions team strives to provide reliable [cloud
server](/faq/cloud-server-instructions) hosting. Once in a while we are
receiving messages that a certain server "*...is not working*". In most
cases this is a problem with the user's equipment used to access the
server, rather than the server itself.  
  
Before sending the report that a server is "not working" use any of the
following tools to confirm that this is indeed the case:

- <http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/demo.mysurvey.solutions>
- <http://currentlydown.com/demo.mysurvey.solutions>  
- <https://isitdownorjust.me/demo-mysurvey-solutions/>
- <https://www.site24x7.com/check-website-availability.html>  
- <http://www.freesitestatus.com/en/quicktest.php>  
- <https://down.com>
- any other alternative tool of this kind.

*These are the third-party tools and we neither produce, nor provide any
training or support related to these tools.*  
  
If the above tools indicate that the server is functional, you will need
to work with your network administrator to resolve the issue.  
  
In your report <span class="underline">**include the information according to the [ORANGE checklist](/faq/issue-reporting/#orange)**</span>:


Specifying all of this information will expedite the handling of
the issue. If any of this information is missing, we may need to contact
you to obtain it, which will delay the troubleshooting.  
  
Occasionally we perform **servers maintenance**, which may involve
rebooting the server and hence a brief interruption in service. These
operations are rare and usually completed within a 15-minute period. If
you are experiencing a server access issue, kindly make sure you have
allowed at least 20 minutes to elapse, and retried before submitting the
server access problem report.  
  
For **new cloud servers** you may need to wait for the network to become
aware of the new server presence. Even if you received the notification
that your new cloud server is up and running, it may take up to 24-hours
for DNS propagation process to complete before you will be able to
actually reach it. In most cases however, this process does not take
more than an hour.
