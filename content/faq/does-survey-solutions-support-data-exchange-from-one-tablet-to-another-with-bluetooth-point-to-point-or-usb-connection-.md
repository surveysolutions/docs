No, current version of Survey Solutions does not support such data
exchange. We see no reliable way to maintain and manage multiple copies
of the same questionnaire on several tablets. While we realize the
benefits of such transfer protocols in certain situations, the risk of
data losses is too high for us to implement this feature.
