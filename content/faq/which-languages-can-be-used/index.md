 - for changing the language of the software itself (Designer and Headquarters components), refer to [Changing the Interface Language](/headquarters/config/changing-the-interface-language/), 
 - for Interviewer refer to [Interface Localization](/interviewer/config/interface-localization/), 
 - for information about multilingual questionnaires refer to [Multilingual Questionnaires](/questionnaire-designer/toolbar/multilingual-questionnaires/).

The questionnaire instrument can be designed in any language supported in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). Survey Solutions will display text and allow entry in Unicode and the entered values will be preserved in the exported data.

{{% note %}}
Some scripts may require an update of the operating system to a version that supports it. For example, Thaana characters are supported by OS Android 6.0 and higher. So even though Survey Solutions can be started on a lower version of Android OS, the Thaana characters may appear incorrectly rendered or not appear at all. Update your Android OS if necessary.
