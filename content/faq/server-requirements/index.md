Server requirements are periodically revised. The characteristics below are
outlined for a survey of no more than 100,000 interviews. 
[Contact support](https://mysurvey.solutions/ContactUs) for a consultation if:

- your survey is larger, or 
- you plan to host several surveys, or 
- if you plan to collect any multimedia data (photos, audio recordings, etc), or
- there are other non-standard circumstances.

Requirements for the server depend on the use and the type of the survey.
Below is a minimal configuration. Better hardware allows better performance.

**Hardware:**

- CPU: 4 physical cores, 64-bit
- RAM: 16GB RAM
- DISK: 500GB SSD

If you are planning to purchase new hardware and wish for the server to be 
operational over the next few years, it is recommended to double the minimal
specifications above.

**Software:**

- OS Microsoft Windows Server 2016 or newer.
- [Microsoft .Net Framework 4.8] (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48).
- PostgreSQL (see [standalone installation instructions](/headquarters/config/standalone-installation/)).

Survey Solutions is working under Microsoft IIS which is 
[built-in into the OS](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/224609/how-to-obtain-versions-of-internet-information-server-iis).

**Server environment:**

The server must be:

- properly cooled;
- physically secured;
- reliably powered 24/7;
- reliably connected to the network/internet with appropriate bandwidth;
- protected from the elements (flooding, fire, etc).
