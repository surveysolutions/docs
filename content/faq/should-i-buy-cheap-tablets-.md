Our users often ask us about the minimal specification for the tablets
to be used with Survey Solutions. While we understand the desire to cut
costs of conducting surveys, we recommend purchasing the most powerful
tablets you can afford. With a very few exceptions, the total survey
budget is much larger compared to the budget you spend even on the most
powerful tablets. Modern tablets provide much better interviewer
experience: they are more responsive and have longer battery life. What
is more important, such tablets have lower per survey costs on the long
run - you will be able to use them for the next two or three years in
multiple surveys.

Please see the [list of
tablets](/faq/what-tablets-should-i-buy)
we tested and recommend for the use with Survey Solutions.
