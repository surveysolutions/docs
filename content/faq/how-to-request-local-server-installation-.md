Survey Solutions supports local installations and cloud servers. For
users who are just starting with Survey Solutions, we recommend using
the WB cloud servers. This will simplify the support and reduce the
costs. Before requesting the cloud server, we expect our users to
familiarize themselves with functionality of Survey Solutions. You need
to create a questionnaire on Questionnaire designer; test your
questionnaire with Tester; test the survey management functionality with
Demo server. After that, please write to support@musurvey.solutions to
request a cloud server.Â   
  
The local server installation is costly to support both for the users
and for the Survey Solutions team. The local server installation is
justified for surveys that collect sensitive data and in other
situations with high data privacy requirements.
