Please [contact](/email-us) our developer team and
request the localization. We will review your request and, if approved,
we will send you Excel files with strings to translate. Once we receive
the files with translation from you, we will try integrating the new
translation into the next release.
  
However, you should realise that the initial translation is just part of
the localisation work. The most time consuming task is to support the
localization for the new versions. The localization files need to be
updated/expanded every time we add or change features in Survey
Solutions.
