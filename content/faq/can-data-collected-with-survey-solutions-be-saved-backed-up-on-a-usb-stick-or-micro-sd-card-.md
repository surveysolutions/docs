No, we do not support such functionality. This feature will unavoidably
lead to data losses and increases in survey management costs. Saving
data to UBS generates multiple versions of data that is very difficult
to maintain without overriding the useful data. To avoid duplication,
Survey Solutions imposes a rule where a particular questionnaire can be
only with one agent in the system.
