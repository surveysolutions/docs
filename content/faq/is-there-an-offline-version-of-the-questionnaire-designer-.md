No. The Questionnaire Designer can only be used online. Survey Solutions
evolves very rapidly and we are introducing new features with each
monthly release. An online designer allows us to maintain the version
compatibility. Another argument in favor of online designer is that in
order to use any CAPI software a tablet has to communicate to a server.
So, the internet connection is necessary for data collection and thus
should also be available for Questionnaire Designer.
