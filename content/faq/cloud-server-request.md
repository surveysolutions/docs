After you have developed and thoroughly tested your questionnaire,
request a new cloud server through Survey Solutions' self-service
portal. To do so, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the self-service server portal.** The address is
    <https://mysurvey.solutions>. 
2. **Log in using your Designer credentials.** These are the
    credentials used to access and edit questionnaires developed with
    Survey Solutions Designer.
3. **Create a new server request.** From the Create Request menu,
    select New server request.
4. **Fill the server request form.** Provide all requested information
    as accurately as possible. Contact the support team with questions
    about the form.
5. **Submit the server request.** Click on the Submit button at the end
    of the form in order to submit your request. Please note that by
    submitting the request, you are designating yourself and your email
    account as the point of contact for all communication regarding the
    server (e.g., admin login credentials, notifications about service
    closing, etc.).

Before submitting a new server request, please note the following:

- For surveys with 100,000 or more interviews 
    {{< contactformurl label="contact us" >}} directly
    with your project details prior to requesting a server;
- Submit a request from the account of that survey's point of contact.
- Submit a separate request for each separate survey effort. While a
    single server can host any number of surveys, users will be best
    served by the followig rule. For each data collection effort,
    request a separate server. If a single survey uses several survey
    instruments, request a single server. If there is more than one
    survey effort, request a separate survey for each survey effort.
- Do not submit a server request to test new functionality. There is a
    publicly available [demo server](/headquarters/config/demo-server) arranged specifically for this purpose.
