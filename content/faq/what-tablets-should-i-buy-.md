Technical Requirements
----------------------

Survey Solutions software works with Android tablets with the following
specifications:Â   
Â 
- **Version of Android:Â **OS Android 4.3.1 or better is required;
    Android 5.0+ is strongly recommended.
- **RAM** Minimum 1.5GB
- **Memory**Â 8GB of flash memory storage.Â At least 1GB of available
    space must be available for Survey Solutionsâ€™ use.Â The Survey
    Solutions software installation package (.apk) is close to 30MB, but
    more space will be required during the operation of the software.
    The ultimate requirements for space depend on the kind of survey
    (questionnaire) and the mode of use of the tablet (number of
    assignments, simultaneously started assignments, rejections, etc.
- **WiFi** module, which can be used for software setup, upgrades, and
    synchronization while in the office.
- **3G/4G** connectivity module is required for synchronization from
    the field.

  
  
Better technical characteristics will improve responsiveness of the
program.  
  
  
**Optional**

-   **Screen size**Â 7-8-inch screens are often chosen. Bigger screens
    consume more power and reduce autonomous work. The choice of the
    screen depends on the convenience of use with the software and is
    usually determined experimentally.

NB: The testing was performed by the developers of Survey Solutions CAPI
software. Conduct your independent testing before volume purchases of
tablets. Same models may be available in different markets under
different model numbers.  
  
  
We are trying to keep this list current. If you tried a different model
and determined it works fine with Survey Solutions, please let us know,
along with the version number of the Survey Solutions software that
youâ€™ve used.
