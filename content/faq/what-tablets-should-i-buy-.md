Technical Requirements
----------------------

Survey Solutions software works with Android tablets with the following
specifications:

- **Version of Android OS**:
  - Android 7.0 or better is required; 
  - All versions of Android below 9.0 are 
[no longer supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history) 
by the manufacturers and correspondingly tablets that can't be updated to 
Android 9.0 or above should be considered unsafe for the World Bank projects.

- **RAM**: Minimum 1.5GB
- **Storage**: 8GB of flash memory storage. At least 1GB of available
space must be available for Survey Solutions' use. The Survey Solutions
software installation package (.apk) is less than 200MB, but more space
will be required during the operation of the software. The ultimate
requirements for space depend on the kind of survey (questionnaire) and
the mode of use of the tablet (number of assignments, simultaneously
started interviews, rejections, use of offline maps, audio recording, etc.
- **WiFi** module, which can be used for software setup, upgrades, and
synchronization while in the office.
- **3G/4G** connectivity module is required for synchronization from
the field.

- **Hardware architecture**: Survey Solutions Interviewer will not be
  able to display maps on
  devices based on x86 architecture, for example, on devices based on
  the *Intel Atom Z3745* chip. This incompatibility is known and will
  not be fixed. Users installing the Interviewer App on such devices
  must opt for the version without the maps.

Minimal requirements are not necessarily going to be optimal for a
particular application. Better technical characteristics will improve
responsiveness of the program and the user experience. Conduct your
independent testing before volume purchases of tablets.


**Optional:**

-   **Screen size** 7-8-inch screens are often chosen. Bigger screens
    consume more power and reduce autonomous work. The choice of the
    screen depends on the convenience of use with the software and is
    usually determined experimentally.
-   **Android 8.0** or higher is recommended because of 
[Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html), 
which should make it easier for the manufacturers to update produced 
devices.


Testing Devices
---------------
We conduct periodic tests of the software and use a range of devices with 
different characteristics. The objective of this testing is to make sure 
each of our releases continues to work on the declared platform. 
Availability, prices and support by manufacturers of these devices vary 
greatly.

We recommend conducting your own independent testing especially before 
purchasing of tablets in bulk.

The World Bank-Survey Solutions team is not in the position of recommending 
specific devices, brands, or vendors.

Share your experience
------------------------

[Survey Solutions users' forum](https://forum.mysurvey.solutions/) is an 
excellent place to share your feedback about particular devices (tablets, 
phones) that you've tried. Most readers will be interested in compatibility, 
performance and usability details that you can provide.

Whether you are providing positive or negative feedback, please, try to 
stay objective and keep it informative and supplemented with useful data. 
Please, mention the device brand, model number, version of Android, and 
version of the Survey Solutions Interviewer app that you've tried, and 
any other details you think may be helpful.
