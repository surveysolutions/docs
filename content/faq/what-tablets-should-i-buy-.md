Technical Requirements
----------------------

Survey Solutions software works with Android tablets with the following
specifications:

- **Version of Android OS**: Android 5.0 or better is required.
- **RAM**: Minimum 1.5GB
- **Storage**: 8GB of flash memory storage. At least 1GB of available
space must be available for Survey Solutions' use. The Survey Solutions 
software installation package (.apk) is less than 100MB, but more space
will be required during the operation of the software. The ultimate 
requirements for space depend on the kind of survey (questionnaire) and 
the mode of use of the tablet (number of assignments, simultaneously 
started assignments, rejections, etc.
- **WiFi** module, which can be used for software setup, upgrades, and 
synchronization while in the office.
- **3G/4G** connectivity module is required for synchronization from 
the field.


Minimal requirements are not necessarily going to be optimal for a 
particular application. Better technical characteristics will improve
responsiveness of the program and the user experience. Conduct your 
independent testing before volume purchases of tablets.
  
  
**Optional:**

-   **Screen size** 7-8-inch screens are often chosen. Bigger screens
    consume more power and reduce autonomous work. The choice of the
    screen depends on the convenience of use with the software and is
    usually determined experimentally.
-   **Android 8.0** we highly recommend choosing tablets with android 8 preinstalled. Starting from this version it should be easier for manufacturers to update existing devices because of [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html).

  Tested Devices
---------------

The World Bank-Survey Solutions team is not in the position of
recommending devices. In January 2016 we have tested several devices
for compatibily with the version of Survey Solutions current at that
time. The description of the tested devices is presented in the table
below for historical purposes, since these devices may no longer be
compatible with the current version of Survey Solutions, and/or may
no longer be available on the market.

NB: The testing was performed by the developers of Survey Solutions CAPI
software. Conduct your independent testing before volume purchases of
tablets. Same models may be available in different markets under
different model numbers.


We are no longer trying to keep this list current. If you tried a different model
and determined it works fine with Survey Solutions, please mention this in the users' forum
along with the version number of the Survey Solutions software that
you've used.
