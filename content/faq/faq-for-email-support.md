1. Before writing your request, study the [documentation](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTPROGRAMS/EXTCOMPTOOLS/0,,contentMDK:23568084~pagePK:64168176~piPK:64168140~theSitePK:8213597,00.html)
    online, [read the FAQ](/faq/), and browse this [knowledge base](http://support.mysurvey.solutions).
    Don't neglect [Google](http://www.google.com) or [other search
    engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine). This is
    usually the fastest way to get your issue resolved. It will also
    help you to use the right terminology when asking a question.

2. Write your request clearly. If we don't understand it, we will ask for
    clarification and it will take longer to resolve your issue.
    Messages simply reporting {{% fntproc class="text-success" %}}"X doesn't work"{{% /fntproc %}}
    or {{% fntproc class="text-success" %}}"X is not working"{{% /fntproc %}} without steps to reproduce the problem will be immediately returned to sender for clarification without further investigation.

3. All of the questions of the kind {{% fntproc class="text-success" %}}"Is it possible to do X in Survey Solutions?"{{% /fntproc %}} or 
    {{% fntproc class="text-success" %}}"How do I do X in Survey Solutions?"{{% /fntproc %}}
    should not be sent to the support team directly, but rather be
    posted to the user forum as public questions: [http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/portal/questions/new](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/portal/questions/new)

4. Introduce yourself, your survey and your questionnaire. Do not assume we or
    other users know what BTLDMS or KVZTS/D is. If you experience a
    compatibility issue (device related) introduce your device (brand,
    model number, manufacturing year, OS version).

5. Do not CC (copy) any other address in your request. Once you receive
    the answer to your request, you can forward it to your partners/co-authors.

6. Place every question into a new request.

7. Confirm promptly if the issue is resolved once you receive the answer. We
    will not be able to address your case until all previous support cases are closed.

8. Once the issue is resolved and you have a new issue, start a new request,
    do not answer to the old thread of the resolved issue. Do not write
    {{% fntproc class="text-success" %}}"Thank you for resolving issue A, and I have two more questions B and C"{{% /fntproc %}}.
    Instead close the thread of issue A confirming it is resolved, start
    a new request for issue B and start another for issue C.

9. Urgent requests: all requests are urgent. Consequently all requests will be
    served in the order they arrive.

10. Use attachments to supplement your case description:

    - place screenshots for interface issues;

    - place long error messages verbatim in a separate text file;

    - include preloading files in text format; explain which tool was used to produce these files;

    - include PDF version of the questionnaire if necessary.

11. Sharing the questionnaire with the agent in the Designer is usually the
    fastest way to explain the problem. If the support agent requests
    the questionnaire to be shared, please comply.

12. In general requests for server maintenance, such as erasing a survey,
    resetting credentials, upgrading the version of the server
    component, etc are expected from the person designated as
    responsible for the server. We reserve the possibility to deny the
    requests from other persons if we canâ€™t reliably establish their
    relationship to the data server in question.

13. Check the support address. This is the support line for the Survey
    Solutions software. If you are experiencing a device issue, perhaps
    you should contact the device manufacturer? If your issue is related
    to a statistical package, refer to the corresponding forum for that
    software.

14. Give each question you submit a meaningful title that explains in short
    what the issue is about. Here are the top ten worse titles for the
    questions we received: *"Question"*, *"Request"*, *"Inquiry"*,
    *"Survey Solutions"*, *"Server"*, *"Urgent"*,
    *"Hello!"*, *"Need help!"* , *"Support"*, *"SOS"*. Instead write *"Can an interviewer be re-assigned to another team?"*, *"Can an
    assignment be rejected more than once?"*, "Error 601 during download
    of binary data file"*, etc.

15. This is a service, not a private email. Do not expect the same agent to
    respond to your every request; {{< fntproc class="text-success" >}}"How are things?"{{< /fntproc >}} is not a support question.
