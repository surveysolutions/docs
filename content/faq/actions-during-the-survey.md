As a designated server administrator you will perform a number of key
activities during the survey field work:

1. Monitor the functioning of the server.
2. Collect and analyze user problem reports. Attempt to address them to
    the extent possible. Refer the users to the corresponding sections
    of the manuals. Elevate the problems requiring developers' attention
    to [support](/email-us).
3. Preserve the copies of the uploaded sample files and split-key
    files.
4. Periodically download, back up, and securely store the export data.
5. Promptly respond to the notifications of the server farm
    administrator.
6. Monitor the progress of the survey. If there is a risk that the
    survey will not be completed within the allocated server life,
    immediately notify the support about the delay, and request server
    extension.Â
