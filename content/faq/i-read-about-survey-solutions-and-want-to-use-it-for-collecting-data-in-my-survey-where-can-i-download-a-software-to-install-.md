Survey Solutions supports local installations and cloud servers. For
users who are just starting with Survey Solutions, we recommend using
the WB cloud servers. This will simplify the support costs. Before
requesting the cloud server, we expect our users to familiarize
themselves with functionality of Survey Solutions. You need to create a
questionnaire on Questionnaire designer; test your questionnaire with
Tester; test the survey management functionality with Demo server. After
that, please write to <support@musurvey.solutions> to request a cloud
server.
