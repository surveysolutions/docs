No, Survey Solutions does not require constant internet connection. The
data collection on tablet can be conducted offline. The internet
connectivity, either 3G/4G or WiFi, is required to synchronize tablet
with the server to send completed assignments and to receive new
assignments. In some cases, i.e., remote Pacific islands, interviewers
go without connection for several weeks. While it is possible not to
synchronize for an extended period of time, we recommend to synchronise
tablets as often as possible, preferably after each interview, if the
connectivity allows.
