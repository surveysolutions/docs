You could modify your questionnaire when the survey is already in the
field. Survey Solutions treats any modifications of a questionnaire as a
new survey. Even if the changes are minor, the modified questionnaire
will be shown as a new survey both on tablets and in the HQ/Supervisor
application.

In general, we strongly advise against making changes in the
questionnaire after the survey goes to the field. We do advise to plan
extensive pre-testing and piloting survey prior to the field. You want
to eliminate as many problems with the questionnaire and the survey
design at the stage of piloting, so that when the survey goes to the
field, no changes are necessary. Modifying questionnaires during the
field work might result in incompatible data generated by the different
versions of the same questionnaire. Even minor changes in the validation
or enablement conditions might lead to disablement of the whole sections
and an rerouting of the questionnaire flow.
