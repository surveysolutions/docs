<P>When deciding on the proper server hosting, please:</P>

- consult all applicable laws and regulations of your country regarding
data storage, transfer and processing, especially when the service provider
indicates that the servers are physically located in a different country or
does not disclose their location.

- note that your organization (educational, governmental, non-profit, etc)
may have rates and pricing different from the generic pricing conditions
that the cloud providers publish. Inquire directly with the cloud server
providers to get the most accurate information on the costs.

- note that the costs may (and often do) vary by region.
