We are constantly on the lookout for new threats and periodically issue patches for any detected vulnerabilities that have a proven potential to be exploited to intercept data or intervene into the operation of the system, notably, our recent [release 21.06](/release-notes/version-21-06/). Several users have already conducted security analysis of our software, but those reports remain the property of the corresponding users.

If you wish to gain access to those reports, post a request at the users' forum soliciting such reports be shared with you directly. (similar to [this post](https://forum.mysurvey.solutions/t/analysis-of-vulnerability-in-local-server-analisis-de-vulnerabilidad-en-servidor-local/3316)). However the responses are all voluntary and not guaranteed. Alternatively, you could hire a professional security reviewer to conduct such an audit, where you will be in control of the scope of testing, deadlines and costs. This will also have the advantage that you can review the current version of the software (or the one that you intend to apply in your operation).

Should you conduct such an analysis it would be useful for us to hear of any defects that it may detect. If you intend to openly publish any scenario for exploit or hack, please note that it is a common practice to give the developers advance warning to be able to close these vulnerabilities before they are published and real damage may result from malicious hackers exploiting scenarios from such publications. This remains, however, at your discretion.

We cannot promise that we can fix all possible problems, or introduce changes to comply with a particular security standard or requirement, or do such changes on a particular schedule. If you determine a particular workaround or have a particular advice for other users, feel free to share using our [users' forum](https://forum.mysurvey.solutions).

Also, please note that the legal conditions of the use of the World Bank site (https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/legal/terms-and-conditions) prohibit:
 
* Attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage or disrupt any parts of the Site, the server on which the Site is stored, or any server, computer or database connected to the Site.
* Attack the Site via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of-service attack.

Various other restrictions may be included in one way or another in the terms of use and compliance is monitored by powers higher than the team developing Survey Solutions software.
Correspondingly, should you conduct such a security analysis, please do this on your own server/installation of Survey Solutions or obtain a corresponding approval from the World Bank team responsible for security of the IT resources.
