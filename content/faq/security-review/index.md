We are constantly on the lookout for new threats and periodically issue patches
for any detected vulnerabilities that have a proven potential to be exploited
to intercept data or intervene into the operation of the system, notably, our
recent [release 21.06](/release-notes/version-21-06/).

Our security policy is located
[here](https://github.com/surveysolutions/surveysolutions/security/policy).
The inventory of currently reported security advisories is published
[here](https://github.com/surveysolutions/surveysolutions/security/advisories).

Users may conduct their own security analysis and share with us. We do not
provide these reports on request of third parties.

Should you conduct such a security analysis, please do this on your own
server/installation of Survey Solutions. Specifically, do not conduct
security analysis on the PDS servers or any other servers hosted by the
World Bank as this will negatively affect other users.
