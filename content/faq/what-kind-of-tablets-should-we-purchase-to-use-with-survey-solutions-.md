Survey Solutions is designed to work on Android tablets. The interface
is optimized to work on tablets with a screen of 7-inch or larger.
Survey Solutions will work on devices with smaller screens (5-inch) but
some users might experience difficulties in reading small fonts. 

Minimal requirements for tablets are described in the following article
