Upon a successful request of the server you will receive an email with
the server address and administrator credentials.  
  
Immediately as you receive this information do the following:

1. Go (in the browser) to the server and log in with the credentials
    you’ve received.
2. Change the password if so desired. Record your new password and
    store securely with your records.
3. Confirm to us per email that you could log in to the server and
    ready for work.
4. Create one or more headquarter accounts (including one for
    yourself).
5. Log out from the administrator account. For your own safety do not
    use administrative account for day-to-day operations. Use
    administrative account exclusively to perform the tasks that HQ
    users can’t perform.
6. Do not share the administrative credentials with anyone. Do not
    forward the email with the credentials to anyone.
7. Do communicate the credentials for the accounts you create on your
    server with the corresponding users (supervisors, interviewers,
    etc). These users do not receive their credentials per email unless
    you send them yourself.
