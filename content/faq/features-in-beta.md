Survey Solutions is an actively developed software. New features are
added in monthly updates. Some of the features are released with status
"beta", meaning they are still being finalized and must be carefully
evaluated for reliability and suitability by our clients.  
  
At the moment the following features are in the status "beta":

- satellite map viewing, positioning, and area measurement on the
    tablets in the Interviewer App. This feature is known to be
    incompatible with Android 64-bit OS.
- shapefile overlay in a geography-type question.
