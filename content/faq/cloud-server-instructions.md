A Survey Solutions data server in the cloud is a secure and convenient
solution. The data server could be provided for free to the end user and
is serviced by the Survey Solutions team. The client has credentials of
the Survey Solutions administrator and has access to the full set of
features available to Survey Solutions administrator (including creating
other user accounts). Besides the requester, only a small number of
people from the Survey Solutions team have access to the server for
support and maintenance.  
  
An administrator of the cloud server must be familiar with the following
procedures:

-   [cloud server request](/faq/cloud-server-request);
-   [actions before the survey
    starts](/faq/actions-before-the-survey-starts);
-   [actions during the survey](/faq/actions-during-the-survey);
-   [actions after the end of the
    survey](/faq/actions-after-the-end-of-the-survey);
-   [deleting a survey](/faq/deleting-a-survey).

  
A survey administrator may or may not be the same person performing the
Headquarter functions. In which case (s)he should also be knowledgeable
of the [Headquarter
responsibilities](http://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters.pdf).
