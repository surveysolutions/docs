Survey Solutions development is responsive to the requests of our users.
Over the years we have incorporated a lot of suggestions from our users
and done improvements to expand functionality and usability of Survey
Solutions based on your advice. We are grateful to our users for sharing
with us their ideas, advice and feedback.  
  
We would like to invite you to submit your ideas and suggestions on how
further to improve the usability our Survey Solutions. Your advice based
on your field experience is invaluable for forming our development
strategy. We promise that every feature and suggestion from you will be
discussed and assessed by our development team. While we cannot
guarantee the timing of your feature implementation we will include many
features you will suggest in our plans. When evaluating a feature
suggestion, we are considering the interests of our existing and
prospective users and costs of development of new features.   
  
Our form collects only basic information about your idea, but be
prepared to elaborate on the feature if we contact you. An important
factor is describing how specifically this feature will benefit your
survey, and how other users may utilize it in their operations. You can
back up your description by pointing to similar features and particulars
of their implementation in other packages, and to the discussion
thread(s) of the feature in the user forum.  
  
Please, fill out this
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7HFPVMEhmKf7E-GFlbBYhCConJtxhO4JSEnI1Pyujw-3nXg/viewform#start=invite)
to submit a feature request.  
  
THANK YOU, FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!
