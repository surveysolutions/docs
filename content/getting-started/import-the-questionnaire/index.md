Survey Solutions. **  
 

**Step 2**

**Step 4**
----------

  
Enter your login information from
[Designer](https://solutions.worldbank.org)   
   
After clicking ***Import template***, you will be asked to enter your
either your username or email, and password for Designer (where you
created your questionnaire), in order to select the relevant template.
**This is not the username for the *headquarters* server.**  
  
If you have forgotten your username or password, go to
<https://solutions.worldbank.org/> and click on the ***Forgot your
password**?* link to create a new password.

**Step 5**
----------

  
Choose the questionnaire template to import to the server.  
   
After you log in, you will be presented with a list of your
questionnaires from Designer. From the list, select the questionnaire
template that you would like to import to the server. To search for your
questionnaire, click on the magnifying glass icon to bring up the search
bar.

----------------------------------

  
Repeat these steps each time you make changes in the questionnaire or
create a new questionnaire  
   
You must go through the steps 1-6 every time you or a member of your
team creates a new questionnaire template or make changes to a template
that has been already imported to the server**. Changes made in
Questionnaire Designer do not automatically propagate to the
headquarters server.**
