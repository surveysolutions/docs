Description
-----------

  
A *stat*![](/images/643217.png)*ic-text* is not a question but a text
that can also be accompanied by a photo. A static-text cannot be
modified by the enumerator, and is not intended to capture data but to
communicate information to the enumerator or the interviewee. The text
can be comprised of alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), basic
punctuation symbols and spaces. You may also use text substitution to
reference questions and user-defined or system-defined variables in the
text.  To do this, enclose the question or variable name with the
percentage sign (%).&gt;

Options

### Add a picture

  
  
In some situations pictures become an indispensable tool to establish
the true meaning of e.g. categories: small, medium, large. Pictures can
be added to the questionnaire wherever a static text element is possible
(including inside rosters and subsections). PNG and JPG file formats are
supported as questionnaire attachments, and the same attachment can be
displayed in multiple places in the questionnaire.   
  
To add a new attachment element:

1.  Click on the paper clip icon on the toolbar on the left hand side.
2.  Click on the green **upload new** button to add an image from your
    disk.  
      
    ![](/images/645292.png)
3.  Define a name for the image
4.  Then, add the attachment to a static. Type in the name of the
    specified attachment in the *Attachment name* box.  
      
    ![](/images/645293.png)  
     

  
Three large images are scaled to fit width to tablet screen when the
questionnaire is displayed on the tablet. The Interviewer app knows how
to render images of different dimensions on different devices taking
into account differences in screen resolutions.  
  
 

### Hide if disabled

  
*Enabling conditions,* which are equivalents of skip patterns in
paper-based questionnaires can be used to enable or disable certain
static-texts based on the answers an interviewee has given in previous
questions.  
  
For more information on how to write logical expressions for enabling
conditions, please see our complete syntax guide.  
  
By default, the static-text will appear greyed out if it is disabled. To
hide static-text if it is disabled, select the *Hide if disabled* check
box.
