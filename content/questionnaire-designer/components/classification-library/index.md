Description
----------------------------------------

The classification library allows users to draw from a library of public and/or private classifications (answer options). More than a convenience feature, the classification library aids with standardization of classifications--that is, alignment with intenational best practices and/or consistency with internal practices.

How to edit classifications

For example, answer categories can be added, deleted, or otherwise changed. Note changes in the target questionnaire do not affect the classification in the library.
