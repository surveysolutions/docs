Description
-----------

![](/images/643211.png)A GPS question expects a set of geographic
coordinates (latitude, longitude, accuracy, altitude), which identify
the location of the tablet. This type of question can be answered using
a GPS-enabled tablet.  
  
  
In addition to using a GPS question to get specific locations (e.g.
household or enterprise), it can also be used to define the area of a
land. An area can be defined by creating GPS questions for each point
that defines the land’s area.
