To see the record of all recent changes made to the questionnaire, click
on the ***History*** button located on the top right of the page. This
page will list the question that was changed along with the username of
the person who made the change, and the time stamp for when the change
occurred.   
  
Starting with [version
5.15](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCOMPTOOLS/Resources/8213623-1380598436379/9346245-1408049903585/ReleaseLetter22.pdf)
(Released December 12, 2016), users can now undo changes that they have
made to a questionnaire. To undo changes in Designer, users can click on
the ***Revert to this version ***button on the right to change the
questionnaire back to that earlier version. For questionnaires edits
made *after* the release of version 5.15, all changes to a questionnaire
can be undone.
