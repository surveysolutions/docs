All questionnaire components with the exception of sections can be
created in the same manner. There are two methods for creating these
questionnaire components (questions, sub-sections, rosters, variables
and static texts). 

  
 

### To create a questionnaire component (except sections):

  
  
***First Method***  
 

 

1.  Click on the *Add Question* button located on the left hand side of
    the navigation pane to create a question. 
2.  If you want to create another type of component, select the downward
    arrow button to the right. 
3.  From the pop-up menu select the questionnaire component that you
    would like to create.

***Second Method***

1.  Locate a questionnaire component within a section that should
    precede the new component.
2.  Right click on the component.
3.  dd question, add sub-section, add roster, add variable or add static
    text.   
      
    ![](/images/643281.png)

  
For questions, static texts, and subsections you may also use text
substitution to reference questions and user-defined or system-defined
variables in the text.  To do this, enclose the question or variable
name with the percentage sign (%)​.  
  
Questionnaire components can be added at the section level (not included
in any sub-section or roster) or within sub-section or rosters.

  
 

### To create a section:

 

1.  Click on the table contents button ![](/images/643289.png) located
    at the top left of the screen. A panel showing all the sections
    within the questionnaire will display.
2.  Click on the *Add New Section* link to add a new section.​
    Here, <span style="line-height: 20.8px;">you may also use text
    substitution to reference questions and user-defined or
    system-defined variables in the text.  To do this, enclose the
    question or variable name with the percentage sign (%)​.  
    ![](/images/643286.png)</span>

  
  
 

 <span id="Select">Select </span>
---------------------------------

 

All questionnaire components with can be selected in the same manner.  
   
 

### **To select a questionnaire component:**

 

1.  In the navigation pane on the left, click on the questionnaire
    component, you would like to work with. If you want to select a
    section, open the questionnaire table of contents with the button
    located on the top left and click on the appropriate section.

 <span id="Copy">Copy</span>
----------------------------

 

You can copy and paste questionnaire components from another
questionnaire or from within a questionnaire you are currently working
on.  
 

### To copy and paste a questionnaire component:

 

1.  Right click on the component you want to copy in the navigation pane
    on the left. If you want to copy a section, right click on the
    section in the questionnaire table of contents.

***If you want to past the sub-section in another questionnaire, open
that questionnaire in Designer.)***

-   Right click on the component that should precede what you have just
    copied.
-   Click on *PASTE AFTER* in the pop-up menu or *PASTE* on the bottom
    right side of the section navigation pane.

    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><img src="/images/643371.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="/images/643372.png" /></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

      
      
    Copying sections from a different questionnaire doesn’t necessarily
    create a valid questionnaire. The copied questions may refer to the
    variables that don’t exist in the new questionnaire or contain
    variable names already utilized elsewhere in the new questionnaire.
    These inconsistencies must be resolved with manual edits.  
      
    Copying and pasting must be done with the same browser. One can’t
    copy and paste to a different browser or any other program.
