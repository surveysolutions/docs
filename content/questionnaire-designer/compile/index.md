To check the questionnaire for errors and system warnings, click on the
***Compile*** button located below the questionnaire name. You can also
use the keyboard shortcut ***Ctrl + B*** to compile the
questionnaire. If no errors and warnings are found, a green text
***OK*** will display.

If errors are found, a red text ***Errors*** with the number of errors
will display, along with a pop up window with the list of errors and the
corresponding links to their location within the questionnaire. If you
dismiss the list of errors window, you can access it again by clicking
on the ***Errors*** link.  
  
When you navigate your mouse pointer over the error, a gray bubble will
appear to the right of the error to provide you more information on what
the error is. This information is meant to help you fix the errors in
your questionnaire. You must address all the errors in your
questionnaire before attempting to test your questionnaire with the
Tester application or importing the questionnaire to Headquarters.
