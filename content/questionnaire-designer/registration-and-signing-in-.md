After signing in with your Questionnaire Designer credentials, you will
be directed to the *My Questionnaires* tab, which is where all the
questionnaires created by you or shared with you can be found.    
  
Questionnaire Designer login policy is affected by the checkbox at
sign-in page:

-   If checkmark is set: once the user has logged in, she can return
    with the same browser within 24 hours without having to re-enter
    credentials;
-   If checkmark is not set: once the user has logged in, and closed
    browser, she will have to enter the credentials again.
