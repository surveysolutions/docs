In this article you will lean how to use the search, and find and
replace features in Designer. These features are particularly useful
when making systematic changes to your questionnaire.  
 

**Search**
----------

   
To search within a section,

1.  Click the search icon (or press Ctrl + F).  
      
    {{< imgproc "images/711616.png" Fit "800x600" />}}

2.  Enter a text in the search box that appears.  
      
    {{< imgproc "images/711618.png" Fit "800x600" />}}

To search within the entire questionnaire (including conditions),

1.  Click the search icon (or press Ctrl + F).

2.  Click on the 3 horizontal dot icon (or press Ctrl + H).  
      
    {{< imgproc "images/711621.png" Fit "800x600" />}}

3.  In the new window, enter a text in the find search box, and click
    *Find All*.  
      
    {{< imgproc "images/711622.png" Fit "800x600" />}}

4.  Click *Previous* and *Next* to see all the elements found in the
    questionnaire.

   
This search not only takes into account the question text, but also
enablement and validation conditions—anywhere the questionnaire designer
has typed text.  
  
You can also further refine your search using the following options:  
 

-   <span class="underline">Match case:</span> Limits the search to
    strings with the same case (e.g., “head” and “HEAD” would be
    different). 

-   <span class="underline">Match whole word:</span> Searches for
    elements of the search term that are stand-alone terms (e.g.
    “headed” would not be confused with “head”).

-   <span class="underline">Use regular expressions:</span> Allows
    advanced users to look for sets of strings that fit a user-specified
    pattern (e.g., “\[Hh\]ead” would find both “Head” and “head”).

   
 

**Find and Replace**
--------------------

   
To find and replace certain words, or phrases in you questionnaire,  
 

1.  Click the search icon (or press Ctrl + F).

2.  Click on the 3 horizontal dot icon (or press Ctrl + H).

3.  In the new window, enter a text in the find search box, and click
    *Find All*.

4.  Click *Previous* and *Next* to see all the elements found in the
    questionnaire.

   
You can also further refine your search using the following options:  
 

-   <span class="underline">Match case:</span> Limits the search to
    strings with the same case (e.g., “head” and “HEAD” would be
    different).

-   <span class="underline">Match whole word:</span> Searches for
    elements of the search term that are stand-alone terms (e.g.
    “headed” would not be confused with “head”).

-   <span class="underline">Use regular expressions:</span> Allows
    advanced users to look for sets of strings that fit a user-specified
    pattern (e.g., “\[Hh\]ead” would find both “Head” and “head”).

1.  Once your search has been refined, type in the new text in the
    *Replace* text box. For example, one could change the recall period
    from the “past 14 days” to the “past 7 days”, or make changes to
    variable names, one could replace “s01q04” with “s01q14” wherever it
    occurs— that is in all enablement conditions and all
    validations.{{< imgproc "images/711623.png" Fit "800x600" />}}

2.  Click Replace All.
