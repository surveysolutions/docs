A [date type
question](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2469077)
requires three components of the date to be specified: year, month, day.
If any of them is not known, the interviewers may not enter the other
ones, even if they are known.  
  
When this is not acceptable, date type question should <span
class="underline">not</span> be used. Instead consider one of the
following alternatives:

1.  Three separate questions;
2.  Patterned text question, with pattern specified as
    \#\#\#\#-\#\#-\#\#
3.  Categorical question with year-month combinations, such as:

-   2016-September
-   2016-October
-   2016-November
-   2016-December
-   2017-January
-   2017-February
-   2017-March
-   2017-April
