Often times researchers work in contexts where respondents of a survey
speak different languages. Therefore, to administer surveys and collect
higher quality data it is important to have questionnaires in the
corresponding language. In Survey Solutions, you can create multilingual
questionnaires directly in Designer as follows:

1.  After you are satisfied with the design of the questionnaire in the
    language of origin, click on the translation button in the advanced
    instrument panel on the left. {{< imgproc "images/710329.png" Fit "800x600" />}}
2.  Click on the link for downloading the questionnaire template in
    excel format. This file can be opened with Microsoft Excel, Open
    Office Calc, and other similar applications.{{< imgproc "images/710331.png" Fit "800x600" />}}
3.  The only fields that should be edited are in the column labeled
    *Translation*.  The translator can refer to the original text on the
    field on the left, and type the translation in the field on the
    right.  
      
    {{< imgproc "images/710337.png" Fit "800x600" />}}  
      
    Answer options are placed in their own dedicated sheet, as shown
    below. The name of each such additional sheet is formed by
    prepending the variable name with a special marker “@@\_”.  
      
    {{< imgproc "images/711150.png" Fit "800x600" />}}
4.  After the translation has been completed, save the file.
5.  Then, go back to the translation panel in Questionnaire Designer and
    click on *Upload New Translation*.  Select your
    file.{{< imgproc "images/710344.png" Fit "800x600" />}}
