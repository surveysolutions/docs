If an interviewer encounters a non-response, she can create a
replacement assignment and enter identifying information herself. To
avoid interviewer&rsquo;s biases, a firm rule must be specified on how to
select the replacement, e.g. &ldquo;next household in order of enumeration&rdquo;.</p><p> </p><table><col style=width:50%><col style=width:50%><tbody><tr class=odd><td style=text-align:center><strong>Pros</strong></td><td style=text-align:center><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr class=even><td style=text-align:center><ul><li>no communication is required;</li><li>works when the replacement households may also refuse, and so on, so as when the number of replacements required may be unknown or large.</li></ul></td><td style=text-align:center><ul><li>behavioral: interviewers know the rule, and may decide to exert lower efforts to secure an interview knowing which household is next based on the replacement rule;</li><li>in the case of non-systematic sample, the interviewer must know, whether the next household is already part of the sample or not, which information she may only get from the supervisor and all other interviewers.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><ol start=8><li>In place replacement</li></ol><hr><p>In this strategy the questionnaire itself is modified to accommodate the
replacement address. This can be done by triggering the &ldquo;<em>Replacement

&ldquo;non-response in target household, interview obtained from a replacement
household&rdquo;.</p><p> </p><table><col style=width:50%><col style=width:50%><tbody><tr class=odd><td style=text-align:center><strong>Pros</strong></td><td style=text-align:center><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr class=even><td style=text-align:center><ul><li>number of assignments in the system is exactly the same as the number of targets;</li><li>reliable link between the households being replaced and their corresponding replacements;</li></ul></td><td style=text-align:center><ul><li>post-processing may be required to generate a consistent variable for the actual location of the household being interviewed;</li><li>behavioral: interviewers know the rule, and may decide to exert lower efforts to secure an interview knowing which household is next based on the replacement rule;</li><li>must rely on interviewers following the rules for selecting the replacement households</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id=discussion>Discussion</h1><p>In every strategy outlined above where the interviewer is allowed to
enter the address of the replacing household, there is a vulnerability
that the interviewer will enter the replacement address incorrectly. A
two-man rule may be introduced, where the interviewers are issued a
checksum computed by the supervisor for a given replacement address, or
a conditional section is locked until replacement is approved by the
supervisor.</p><p>In those strategies where the interviewers are issued the replacement
assignments right away, it is possible to password-protect the
assignment with an individual password (generated at HQ and visible to
the supervisors, but not to the interviewers). In that case interviewers
may only proceed to the replacement interviews when such password is
communicated to them by their respective supervisor or an HQ-user.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t know which strategy to prefer, discuss whether connectivity
is expected in the enumeration areas, whether the full list of the
households is available before the interviewers proceed to the
enumeration areas, and other factors which will help you to shorten the
list of available options.</p><p><strong>If unsure, select strategy #6 as it provides the best protection
against the interviewers&rsquo; biases, albeit at a cost of requiring
communication.</strong></p><p>There are potentially other strategies, which extend the ones outlined
above or achieve the same results using additional external
media/lists/cards/maps etc. Depending on the nature of the survey,
number of visits and other factors one or the other strategy may be more
suitable, however the final quality of data will depend on how the
replacement strategy has defended against the interviewers biases.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer pt-3 pb-1 px-sm-3 px-lg-0"><div class="container copyright"><div class=float-left>&#169; 2016-2025 The World Bank Group.<br>All rights Reserved. <a href=https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/legal _target=blank>Legal</a><br><a class=text-primary href=/about/ _target=blank><b class=text-primary>About the team</b></a>
