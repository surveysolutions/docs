common problems and design errors. The following table summarizes the messages
issued by the Designer when the questionnaire is compiled.</p><p>Some of these messages indicate a situation of an <em>error</em>, where the current
questionnaire is invalid and may not be used for data collection until the
indicated problem is fixed. For example, these are the syntax errors in
expressions (see <code>WB0002</code> or <code>WB0003</code> below) or duplication of identifiers of
variables (<code>WB0026</code>), and other similar problems.</p><p>Other messages correspond to a situation of a <em>warning</em>, which hint on a
potential improvement in efficiency, or a notable situation, which may be
something to evaluate in the context of a specific survey. For example,
Survey Solutions Designer may detect that the same categories are defined in
several different questions, and advise to make use of
<a href=/questionnaire-designer/toolbar/reusable-categories/>reusable categories</a>:
see <code>WB0296</code> below. While this is not an error, it is something that will make
the management of these sets of categories easier and reduce the work for
translators of the questionnaire to other languages. Another example is a
warning about the absence of a GPS question in the questionnaire. Having the
location of the interview opens up great possibilities for data analysis,
integration, and quality control, and is easily obtainable with modern tools,
so it can very well be an oversight that it is not included, and yet it is not
mandatory and up to the author of the questionnaire to decide whether to
include it or not in a particular survey questionnaire.</p><table class="table table-striped table-hover>
