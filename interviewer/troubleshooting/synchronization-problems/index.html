complex process of communication during which a number of actions are
undertaken on both ends based on the flow of incoming data. Survey
Solutions hides the complexity of it behind a simple Synchronize button
available to the interviewer at any time. Normally, when synchronization
is completed successfully, the interviewer receives a confirmation
message and some summary statistics describing the actions taken (such
as number of received assignments or transferred interviews).</p><p>In some cases synchronization stops with errors. Interviewers should
remember that</p><ol><li>it is always safe to press the synchronization button again to
retry. When the errors are caused by interference or noise in
communication channel the synchronization is likely to succeed when
repeated.</li><li>if your supervisor has instructed you to synchronize (and this is
important in some scenarios) and your synchronization has resulted
in errors, then you haven&rsquo;t synchronized. Only when you received a
confirmation message that the synchronization has completed
successfully, then the synchronization is performed.</li></ol><p>In countries with less reliable networks the probability of a failed
synchronization is higher. It is also higher for longer synchronization
sessions, such as ones where a large number of interviews are being
synchronized or when the interviews have a large amount of data.
Synchronizing frequently helps the whole system running.</p><p>Synchronization is a process of communication between the tablet and a
server, in which the connection is initiated by the tablet, which
searches and sends a query to the server. Hence the server must be
active and visible at all times when the interviewers might be
synchronizing (during all data collection period).</p><p>The tablet is searching the server by name, known as the
<em>synchronization point</em>, which is an URL of the server in the network.
This setting is entered once when the Survey Solutions App is installed
and logged in for the first time. Normally it doesn&rsquo;t change throughout
the data collection, though a possibility to change it exists in the
<a href=/interviewer/troubleshooting/interviewer-app-settings/>Interviewer app settings</a>.</p><p><strong>If you are experiencing a repetitive synchronization error after several
retries, the simplest action you can do is to navigate to the
synchronization point in your browser (typically Chrome on Android devices),
for example, <a href=https://demo.mysurvey.solutions>https://demo.mysurvey.solutions</a>.
The page that opens will usually contain some readable information about the
con√ünectivity problems. This will help you track down the exact reason
for the problem and use the troubleshooting guide below to find a remedy
